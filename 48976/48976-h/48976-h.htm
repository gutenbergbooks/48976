<h2>To All Delaware Children</h2>


<p class='unindent'>Dear Girls and Boys:</p>

<p>These true stories are written just for you.
They tell how once upon a time brave men and
women came across the ocean and landed here in
the wilderness, among the Indian tribes; how
they made farms and towns and cities and
formed a state; and how they fought for the
freedom and the peace that Delaware now enjoys.
Only thirteen out of the forty-eight states
of our Union are original colonies, and Delaware
is one of these famous thirteen. You are the
young citizens, therefore, of an historic state.
To you it will fall, some day, to uphold the honor
of Delaware. May you be as patriotic and as
brave as the Delaware settlers who conquered
the wilderness and the Delaware soldiers who
laid down their lives for liberty and right.</p>

<h2>Editor’s Preface</h2>


<p>This book is published by the Delaware Society
of the Colonial Dames of America for the use,
primarily, of the children of Delaware, in school
and out. Its style and matter are therefor
chosen to suit young readers.</p>

<p>Many historical points in these stories are
more or less disputed. The original sources do
not always agree. In preparing these stories of
Delaware for children’s reading, it has been
thought best to use anecdotes and interesting
traditions whenever they could be found. The
result is a substantially true set of stories, which
do not however, undertake to settle the facts in
any disputed case, but are designed to leave in a
child’s mind the broad outlines of Delaware
history.</p>

<p>The stories have all been read and revised by
the Hon. Alexander B. Cooper of New Castle,
to whom the thanks of the Colonial Dames are
here expressed for his wise and constant help.
The Rev. Joseph B. Turner, of Dover, has also
kindly read over several of the stories.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>IT was a clear warm day in May in
the year 1631, and the sunlight
shone pleasantly on a little Indian
village of the Leni Lenapes on the banks of the
broad Delaware river.</p>

<p>From the openings in the tops of the wigwams—openings
that answered in place of chimneys—the
smoke of the fires rose toward the cloudless
May sky. Kettles were suspended over these
fires, and from their contents came a savory smell
of cooking—of game, of fish, or of a sort of hasty
pudding that the squaws make of corn, which
they have ground to meal between stones.</p>

<p>A number of the young men had gone off
to the forest in search of game, or had paddled
away in their canoes to distant fishing grounds,
but some of them were still left in the village.
Now and then a brave stalked with grave dignity
among the wigwams; and the three chiefs,
Quescacous, Entquet, and Siconesius sat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
little withdrawn, and in the shadow of some
trees, smoking together.</p>

<p>An Indian youth who was setting a trap down
by the river paused, when he had finished his
task, to look up and down the stream for returning
canoes. There was none in sight, but what
he did see caught his attention and brought a
startled look of wonder to his face. He bent
forward in eager attention and gave vent to a
low guttural exclamation. Down toward the
bay two objects such as he had never seen before
moved slowly over the surface of the water.
They moved like great birds with wide spread
wings; but they were no birds, as the Indian
knew well. Whatever they were, they were the
work of human hands, and they were coming
toward the village.</p>

<p>Once satisfied of this, the Indian turned and
sped back to the wigwams to carry the news.</p>

<p>What he had to tell was enough to arouse not
only the interest of the younger Indians, but of
the braves and the chiefs as well. Soon a group
of natives had gathered on the shore, all gazing
down toward the bay.</p>

<p>And a marvellous sight it must have been to
those Indians that May morning when the two
ships of the first colonists who ever settled in
Delaware came sailing up the river toward them.
In the lead came a vessel of eighteen guns, her
sails spread wide to the light breeze, the flag of
Holland floating from her masthead. Following
her was a smaller yacht named the <i>Walrus</i>.
Over the sides of these vessels leaned the sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and the colonists, blue eyed and fair haired,
dressed in cloth suits and glittering buttons.</p>

<p>These immigrants gazed with wonder at the
strange natives gathered on the shore—at their
painted faces and feathers; and they saw with
joy the beauty of this new land. For five
months these ships had sailed the trackless
ocean, now beaten by storms, now driven on
by favoring winds; and now at last, under their
leader, DeVries, they had reached their haven.</p>

<p>They were not the first white men who had
sailed these waters. Long, long before, Hudson
had come this way on his search for a north-east
passage to China. In 1612 Hendrickson had
ventured up the river in his little ship <i>Restless</i>,
but neither of these had set foot on the land,
unless it was to seek a spring for water to drink.
These men under DeVries in 1631 were the first
who ever made an attempt to settle.</p>

<p>Very joyously these first colonists landed in
Delaware. Flags were flying and music playing.
The cannon of the ship boomed out a salute
across the water. It reverberated solemnly
over the wild and lonely country where such a
sound had never been heard before. The colonists
were so delighted with the peace and the
beauty of the land that they named the point
where the boat first touched, <i>Paradise Point</i>. It
is the little projection of land at the mouth of
what is now known as Lewes Creek.</p>

<p>The three chiefs, gorgeous in paint and feathers,
came down to meet the strangers and conducted
them up the shore to the village. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they motioned to them to seat themselves
around the fire and smoke the pipe of peace.</p>

<p>The various small tribes of Indians in Delaware
all belonged to the one great tribe of the
Leni Lenapes.</p>

<p>DeVries, on his side, was very anxious to establish
friendly relations with them. He believed
that if the natives were treated fairly and kindly
there would be no trouble with them.</p>

<p>We do not know how the bargain was made
between the Indians and the white men, whether
by signs or whether through an interpreter sent
down from the New Netherlands (New York)
which had been settled some time before. But
we are told in the old documents that this first
tract of land, thirty-two miles along the bay
and river from Cape Henlopen, was sold by the
Indians for “certain parcels of cargoes,” probably
kettles, cloth, beads and ornaments.</p>

<p>After the bargain was made, DeVries again
took ship; and the three chiefs sailed with him up
to New Netherlands, where a solemn deed was
made before the three chiefs and signed and
sealed by the Dutch Governor and the Directors,
Council and Sheriff of the New Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Down in the newly purchased land the colonists
immediately set about building shelters
for themselves. Their possessions had been
landed with them—their chests of clothing, their
farming tools, and the seeds they had brought
from home. They must begin to prepare fields,
too; for it was time the seeds were planted.</p>

<p>The spot they selected was near the mouth of
the creek, where there was a spring of delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
cool water; and, because of the wild swans that
were sometimes seen there, they named their
little settlement Zwannendael. The river they
called Hoornekill in honor of DeVries, whose
native place was Hoorne in Holland.</p>

<p>The natives watched with wonder the strange
work of these colonists, and the square houses
with doors and windows which they made, and
which were so different from the round wigwams
woven of boughs and barks.</p>

<p>Beside separate cabins the settlers built
themselves a general house to serve as defense
in time of need. They called it Fort Uplandt;
but DeVries placed such extraordinary confidence
in the Indians that the so-called fort was
only a house, larger and stronger than the cabins,
and surrounded by a high fence.</p>

<p>So diligently did the settlers go about their
work that by the middle of the summer they
were quite well established.</p>

<p>DeVries was anxious to go back to Holland
and bring out more settlers, so he appointed
Giles Hosset<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Director of the colony and then
made his preparations to sail.</p>

<p>It was with heavy hearts that the little band
of colonists saw the ship that had brought them
from home spread its wings and sail away.</p>

<p>They watched it until it was only a speck in
the distance, until even the speck had disappeared.
Then they turned again to their work with
a new feeling of loneliness. They were so few in
that great land of savages.</p>

<p>They had provisions enough, brought from
home to last them a year and there was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
comfort in the fact that the yacht <i>Walrus</i> was
left behind. She was anchored just off shore in
the river, and from there she could keep guard
over the little colony like a mother bird guarding
her nest. If danger arose, the settlers could
retreat to her. But what danger was there to
fear when the Indians seemed so peaceable
and friendly?</p>

<p>For some months after DeVries left them, all
went well; and then trouble arose. The trouble
was over a very little thing, no more nor less
than a little square of tin.</p>

<p>One of the first things the colonists had done
after settling their farms, was to erect a pillar,
and place on it a piece of tin carved with the
arms of the United Provinces, as Holland was
called. Those arms, set high above the village,
were to them a constant reminder of their old
home across the sea; and often, as they went to
and fro about their work, their homesick eyes
would turn to it for comfort.</p>

<p>But one morning when the colonists arose to
go to their daily toil, the piece of tin was missing.
Evidently, someone had wrenched it from its
place in the night.</p>

<p>Angry and excited, the colonists began to
make inquiries. For a time they learned nothing
of how or why it had been taken, but at
length they found it had been stolen by an old
chief to make tobacco pipes. Then the colonists
were more angry than ever. It seemed an
insult to their country that her arms should
have been put to such a base use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives were much alarmed when they
found how angry the settlers were. They did
not understand why they set such value upon the
arms. Was the piece of tin something sacred—something
that the pale faces worshiped? Out
in the river lay the <i>Walrus</i>, seeming to threaten
them with its presence; and soon the great sachem
DeVries would return, unless they could
make their peace with the pale faces.</p>

<p>A few days later some of the natives came to
the settlement, bringing a gift to the white men—a
gift that they hoped might soothe the anger
of the settlers. It was the bloody scalp of the
old chief. They had killed him and brought
this as a peace offering.</p>

<p>The settlers, with Giles Hosset at their head,
were overcome with horror.</p>

<p>“What have you done!” Hosset cried, “Why
did you not bring him to the fort? We could
have reproved him, and told him that if he did
such a thing again he would be punished. But
you yourselves should be punished for this.
It is a bloody and barbarous act!”</p>

<p>The Indians heard him with sullen look.
They in their turn were enraged. They had
thought to please the white men by killing the
white men’s enemy, and now the white men
were more angry than ever. The natives dissembled,
however; they went away with calm
looks, but black rage was in their hearts.</p>

<p>Giles Hosset was deeply troubled.</p>

<p>“Evil will surely come of this,” he said.
“Innocent blood has been shed, and something
tells me that more will follow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>However, the next few days passed peacefully.
Giles Hosset’s fears began to die away. The
Indians were apparently as friendly as ever, and
the whole tragic event seemed to have been forgotten.
But it was not. There were friends of
the chief who remembered and blamed the pale
faces for his death, and whose hearts were full
of hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>One morning the little ship <i>Walrus</i> drew up its
anchor and sailed down the bay and out into the
ocean to look for whales. There were said to be
a great many along the coast, and an Indian had
brought them news of one that had been spouting
outside at dawn.</p>

<p>The colonists were gathering in their crops,
and the little cluster of cabins lay peaceful and
deserted in the golden autumn sunlight. Two
people only were left in the strong house. One
was a man who was sick and so unable to work;
the other was a stout, strong fellow who stayed
there on guard. A great brindled mastiff was
chained to the wall by a strong staple. He lay
asleep, sometimes rousing himself to snap lazily
at the flies. The guard was sharpening some
farm implements; the man on the bed lay
watching him, and now and then they chatted
idly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great mastiff lifted its head and
listened. Then it sprang to its feet, struggling
against the chain and growling ominously.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the sick man.</p>

<p>The guard went to the door and looked out.</p>

<p>“Indians,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indians?” repeated the sick man, “I like
not that they should come here when all the
others are away and out of call.”</p>

<p>However, it seemed that these Indians had
come on a matter of barter. They had with
them a stack of beaver skins, which they wished
to exchange for cloth or provisions. They
spread them out on the floor, and the white
men grew quite interested in examining them.</p>

<p>Presently they made their bargain, and the
guard said he would go up to the loft and get
certain of the stores that were kept there.</p>

<p>One of the Indians followed him up and stood
around as he selected the things he was to exchange
for the skins. Then, as the guard
started down the ladder, swift as lightning the
Indian struck him with an axe he had picked up,
and crushed in his head. The man had not
even time to cry out.</p>

<p>Immediately, and as though this sound had
been the signal, the natives fell upon the sick
man and killed him. Others rushed upon the
dog, but there they met with such a fierce defense
that they fell back. The brave beast
pulled and struggled against the chain, and a
moment later he fell pierced by a shower of
arrows.</p>

<p>When nothing was left alive in the strong
house, the Indians went out to where the colonists
were quietly at work in the fields, guessing
nothing of the tragedy that had just been enacted
at the strong house.</p>

<p>The Indians approached them tranquilly,
their weapons carefully concealed. So friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
were their looks that the white men felt no fear;
but only Giles Hosset, remembering the death
of the chief, watched them with some uneasiness.
But even he had no faintest suspicion of the
bloody work so soon to begin.</p>

<p>When the Indians were quite close to the
settlers, their friendly look suddenly turned to
one of ferocity and hate. Weapons were flourished,
they burst into their terrible war cry and
fell upon the defenseless colonists. So thorough
was their work that, when it was ended, not one
white man was left alive to tell the tale of the
terrible massacre of Zwannendael.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, out in the ocean, the <i>Walrus</i> had
cruised about all day; but the sailors had seen
no signs of the whales the Indians had told of
and at evening they came sailing home.</p>

<p>What was their surprise, as they approached
the settlement, to see no signs of life. They
could not understand it. Only when they
reached the strong house and saw the bodies of
the men and the dog, did they begin to guess at
the terrible tragedy of that day.</p>

<p>They hastened to the field where they had left
their friends cheerfully at work that morning.
Not one was left alive.</p>

<p>Filled with despair, the survivors hurried
back to their ship. The native village too, was
empty, the Indians had disappeared; but the
white men were afraid to stay on the shore.
They spent the night on the <i>Walrus</i>, and the
next day set sail for Holland to carry the sad
news to DeVries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>We are told that DeVries had almost finished
his preparations and was expecting soon to
return to Zwannendael, but that when he
heard the tidings he was overcome.</p>

<p>The return voyage was given up, for the new
colonists were afraid to risk the fate of the
others. And so, in the massacre of Zwannendael,
ended the first settlement ever made on
Delaware soil.</p>

<p>Yet still the land had been possessed by the
Dutch. It was not, any more, unclaimed land
that belonged to any man that came along.
When the King of England gave away all the
land along that part of the coast to Lord Baltimore,
only three years later, he could not give
this land of Delaware, because it had already
been settled by DeVries for Holland. Our
state began when the Dutch colonists first
stepped ashore on Paradise Point.</p>

Built A Fort.</h2>

<p class='dropcapstory'>SPRING had come again. The sun
shone as bright and clear as when,
seven years before, DeVries and his
Dutch settlers had sailed up the Delaware and
landed on its shores.</p>

<p>That was in 1631. Now it was the year 1638,
and two other vessels<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were sailing up the
broad river. But these ships were not Dutch;
they carried the colors of Sweden, and the men
who crowded to the sides of the vessels to gaze
at the unknown shores were Swedes.</p>

<p>Six months before, these men, fifty in all, had
started out from Gottenburg to journey across
the sea to this new land. For six months they
had been tossed and beaten by many storms
upon the ocean, but now at last they had
reached the promised land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly they sailed up the river and past
the mouth of the Hoornekill.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The colonists
stared in silence at the spot where the little
settlement of Zwannendael had once stood.
Nothing marked the place now but a few
blackened ruins; and these, wind and storm
were slowly eating away.</p>

<p>The Swedes did not stop there, but sailed on
up the river. Their commander, Peter Minuit,
had once been with the West India Company
at New Netherlands, and knew something
of the country and had a clear idea of where
he wished to start his colony. Some miles above
the Hoornekill, Minquas Creek (now our Christiana)
emptied into the Delaware. Two and a
half miles from its mouth, a point of rocks<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
jutted out into the stream and made a sort of
natural wharf. It was upon this point that
the Swedes made their landing.</p>

<p>Stores and implements were carried to the
shore, and soon the silence of the new land was
broken by the sound of the ax and the voices
of the settlers talking and calling to one another.</p>

<p>Lonely and deserted as the country had seemed
to the new settlers, their coming was quickly
known to both the Indians and the Dutch.</p>

<p>The first to visit them was an Indian Chief
named Mattahoon. He and some of his braves
stalked in among the colonists one day, with
silent Indian tread, and stood looking about
them with curious, glittering black eyes. Minuit
gave them some presents, and they seemed
much pleased. Then Mattahoon told Minuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that the land belonged to him and his braves.</p>

<p>Minuit wished to buy it from him, and the
Sachem agreed to sell it for a copper kettle and
some other small articles. These were given to
him, and he and his braves went away, well
content with their bargain.</p>

<p>The next visitor to come to them was a messenger
from New Amsterdam. He told them that
Director General Kieft, the Dutch Governor,
had sent him to ask why they had settled on
land that belonged to the Dutch. The Dutch
had bought it from the Indians long ago, at the
time DeVries had settled on the river.</p>

<p>Minuit answered the messenger very civilly.
He gave the Dutchman to understand that he
and his Swedes were on their way to the West
Indies, and had only landed on this shore for
rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>The messenger believed what Minuit said,
and was quite satisfied, and the next day he
returned to New Amsterdam and told Kieft
there was nothing to fear from these strangers;
they were only passers-by and had no wish to
settle upon the river.</p>

<p>However, not long after this, a Dutch ship
sailing up the river saw that the strangers were
still there. Moreover, they were building houses
and something that looked like a fort, and gardens
were laid out.</p>

<p>Kieft, the Dutch Governor was very angry
when he heard this. Again he sent a messenger
in haste, to ask why the Swedes were building,
and to demand that they should re-enter their
ships and sail away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Minuit paid but little attention to this second
messenger. He was very busy. The fort was
almost finished. Reorus Torkillus, a clergyman
who had come from Sweden with him, had already
held services in it, and had prayed for the
welfare of their little settlement of Christinaham,
for that was what they had named it.
The fort itself was called Fort Christina, in honor
of the Swedish Queen, and the name of the
creek was changed from Minquas to Christina.</p>

<p>It was of no use for the Dutch to send messengers
now. The Swedes were well established.
Moreover, they had made friends with the
Indians. Minuit had given them a number of
presents—kettles, cloth, trinkets, and even
fire-arms and ammunition.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With these presents the savages were delighted;
and they signed a paper with their marks,
giving to the Swedes all the land from Cape
Henlopen to Santican, or what is now called
the Falls of Trenton. When the Dutch heard
this, they were indignant for they claimed that
all that land had already been sold to them.</p>

<p>Reorus Torkillus, the Swedish minister for
the little settlement, did what he could to keep
peace with both the Dutch and the Indians.
He was an earnest, pious man, and his great hope
was that he might convert the savages to
Christianity. He regularly held Divine service
in the fort. He also had a plot of ground fenced
off to serve as a burying ground when such might
be needed.<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Indians understood but little of the teachings
of Torkillus; but there was one thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they did understand, and that was that the
Swedes gave them many presents and paid
them better for their furs and skins than the
Dutch did. Minuit, indeed, was always careful
to find out what the Dutch were paying them
and then to offer a little more. In this way he
secured all the best and choicest of the furs—a
cause of fresh anger to the Dutch.</p>

<p>But with all this friendly feeling between the
Swedes and the Indians, the settlers were obliged
to be on their watch with the savages. The
Leni Lenapes, to which the Delaware tribes belonged,
were for the most part a peaceful people;
but there often appeared among them Indians
from another tribe, probably Iroquois, whom the
settlers called “Flatheads.”<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These strange
Indians were both cruel and treacherous, and
they made it dangerous for a settler to venture
out of sight or hearing of the settlement. Often
they would hide in the woods and fall upon some
lonely wanderer, and kill or stun and then scalp
him.</p>

<p>The scalping itself was not always fatal.
There is a story of a drunken soldier who fell
asleep across his gun. When he awoke, he had
a strange feeling in his head. At first he thought
it was the effect of what he had drunk, but
presently, to his terror, he found he had been
scalped. And there is a story too, of a woman
who had gone into the forest to gather fire-wood.
She was struck down, stunned, and scalped by a
Flathead, but she lived many years afterward.
Her hair, however, never grew out again, except
as a fine down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another thing about the Indians
that, as time went on, made the settlers more and
more anxious. In order to keep them in good
temper, it was necessary to continue to give
them presents. At first it was easy for the
colonists to do this, for they had brought with
them from Sweden a large store of things for
that very purpose. But as time went on, their
stores dwindled away. They had expected ships
from home to bring them a fresh supply, but no
ships came.</p>

<p>Week after week and month after month
passed by; the home land seemed to have forgotten
them. Their cloth was all gone, their
clothes were threadbare, and many of their
cattle had died. The Indians came to Christinaham,
expecting presents, and went away with
angry looks and empty hands.</p>

<p>In the year 1640 the Chief Mattahoon called
together a great meeting of the sachems and
warriors of Delaware. The meeting was held
deep in the wood where no white man could
come. All the chiefs and braves were gathered
there, old and young. They ate and drank.
Then Mattahoon spoke to them. He asked
them whether it would not be better to kill all
the Swedes. He said:</p>

<p>“The Swedes live here upon our land, they
have many forts and houses, but they have no
goods to sell us. We find nothing in their stores
that we want. They have no cloth, red, blue, or
brown. They have no kettles, no brass, no
lead, no guns, no powder. But the English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the Dutch have many things. Shall we kill all
the Swedes or suffer them to remain?”<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>An Indian warrior answered:</p>

<p>“Why should we kill all the Swedes? They
are in friendship with us. We have no complaint
to make of them. Presently they will
bring here a large ship full of all sorts of good
things.”</p>

<p>With this speech all the others agreed. Then
Mattahoon said:</p>

<p>“Then we native Indians will love the Swedes,
and the Swedes shall be our good friends. We
and the Swedes and Dutch shall always trade
with each other.”</p>

<p>Soon after this the meeting was dissolved, and
all the Indians returned to their own villages.</p>

<p>The Swedish settlers knew nothing of this
meeting, but they had felt that they were in
danger. It was in March of that year, 1640,
that they decided, with sad hearts, to give up
their little settlement and remove to New
Amsterdam. Preparations were made for abandoning
Christinaham. Tools and provisions
were packed, and the boats made ready.</p>

<p>The Dutch heard with joy that the little settlement
was to be given up. At last they would
be rid of their troublesome neighbors.</p>

<p>However, the very day before the Swedes were
to leave, a vessel arrived from Sweden, bringing
them cattle, seeds, cloths and all the things of
which they were so in need. The ship also
brought a letter from the wise Swedish Councillor
Oxenstiern and his brother. In this letter,
the colonists were encouraged in their undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and told to keep brave hearts. They
were also promised that two more vessels should
be sent out to them in the spring.</p>

<p>When the colonists heard this news, they
shouted for joy. The household goods which
they had packed with such heavy hearts were
now unpacked, the houses were opened, and
the work of the village was taken up again.</p>

<p>The Indians were greatly pleased. Now they
saw how wise they had been to have patience and
wait, instead of killing all the Swedes as they had
been tempted to do. The Swedes were again
their best friends, and the givers of many gifts.</p>

<p>The Dutch were obliged to swallow their disappointment
as best they could, for now the
Swedes were more firmly settled than ever.
Fields were tilled, and orchards planted. Later
on they built forts at the mouths of various
Creeks, so as to prevent the Dutch from trading
with the Indians.</p>

<p>When, in 1643, Lieutenant Printz came out
from Sweden to take the position of Governor;
he built a handsome house on Tinnicum Island,
just above Chester, and also a fort and a church.<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The principal Swedes built their houses around
this fort, and the village that arose back of it
was called “Printzdorf.” Thus the capital of
New Sweden was removed from Christinaham
to Tinnicum Island.</p>

<p>The Governor held absolute power over the
little colony, and all matters were decided by
him according to his own will.</p>

<p>There were, at this time, two kinds of people
upon the Delaware; the freemen, who owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
their own land and farmed and traded, and prisoners,
who had been sent over from Sweden on
the earliest vessels, and who were employed in
digging ditches and hewing and building, and
were treated as slaves. In fact, there was no
lack of laborers in the colony.</p>

<p>Rich cargoes of furs and tobacco were now
sent back to Sweden. The Dutch were in despair.
They saw all the Indian trade being taken
out of their hands; but Sweden was too powerful
both at home and abroad for them to dare to
interfere with her, and from this time until
Stuyvesant came out to be Governor of the
New Netherlands the Swedes ruled supreme
along the Delaware.</p>

<p>The spot where the Swedes first landed is
still preserved, and is marked by a portion of the
original rock, placed close to the landing-place on
the bank of the Christiana. This rock bears
an inscription, and is enclosed by a low iron
railing. It may be called the Plymouth Rock
of Delaware, for it is taken from the natural
wharf of rocks on which the Swedes first stepped,
and marks the first permanent settlement made
in Delaware.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>PETER STUYVESANT was a tall, red-faced
Dutchman who came out to the New
Netherlands in 1647, to take the place of
Kieft as Governor of that Province.</p>

<p>Governor Stuyvesant had fought in many
battles, and in one of them had lost a leg.
When he came out to New Netherlands he had a
wooden leg; and as it was fastened together by
rings of silver, it was often called “the Governor’s
silver leg.” Stuyvesant had also a very violent
temper; and, when he was angry, he stamped
about with this leg as though it were a club and
he were beating the floor with it.</p>

<p>At this time, in 1647, the Swedes claimed all
of Delaware as theirs, and called it New Sweden.
They had driven many of the Dutch away, had
torn down their buildings, and had kept them
from trading with the Indians. Every little
while news of fresh wrongs to the Dutch was
brought from Delaware to Governor Stuyvesant;
and every time a letter or messenger arrived,
the Governor had a fresh fit of rage. He believed
that the Dutch were the real owners of
the river; and, if he could, he would have gathered
his soldiers together and sailed down to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Sweden, and have done his best to drive every
Swede out of the country.</p>

<p>This he could not do, however; for the Directors
of the West India Company, who had given
him his position as Governor, had told him to
keep peace not only with the Indians, but with
the Swedes as well.</p>

<p>This was a hard thing for a hot-tempered man
like Stuyvesant to do. Now the story would
be that the Swedes had destroyed more of
the Dutch buildings along the Delaware; again,
that the Swedes had incited the Indians to try to
surprise and massacre the Dutch; and Hudde,
the Dutch commissioner in New Sweden, wrote
that a Swedish lieutenant and twenty-four
soldiers had come to his house one day and cut
down all his trees, even the fruit trees.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant stamped about louder than ever
when he heard this. The insult to the Dutch
commissioner seemed the worst thing that had
yet happened; and he made up his mind to sail
down to New Sweden and remonstrate with the
Swedish Governor Printz himself.</p>

<p>Governor Printz lived in a very handsome
house called Printz Hall, on Tinnicum Island.
All about it were fine gardens and an orchard.
There was also a pleasure house, and indeed
everything that could help to make it comfortable
and convenient. Governor Printz received
Governor Stuyvesant very politely in the great
hall of the house, and presently the two governors
sat down and began to talk. Stuyvesant
complained bitterly of the treatment the Dutch
had received in Delaware. He repeated that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
rights the Dutch really owned the land; they had
bought it years before from the Indians, and
their right to it had been sealed by the blood
they had shed upon its soil.</p>

<p>Printz himself was a very violent man, and
often gross and abusive; but this time he kept
his temper and answered the Dutch Governor
civilly. Stuyvesant, though, gained nothing by
his visit, and all his talk and reasoning. Printz
was determined to keep all the land along the
Delaware, and to govern it as he pleased. As to
cutting down Hudde’s trees, he said he had had
nothing to do with that matter, and was sorry it
had happened.</p>

<p>So Stuyvesant went back to his own fine house
at New Amsterdam, and the Dutch in New
Sweden were no better off.</p>

<p>However, he was not one to let the matter rest
at that. He kept it in his mind, and at last, as
the result of his thinking, he sent messengers to
all the Indian sachems along the Delaware, inviting
them to come to a great meeting at the
governor’s house in New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The meeting was set for early in July; and, on
the day appointed, the Indians came. They
were grave and fierce looking, in spite of their
gay paint and feathers. Stuyvesant received
them in the hall of his house; and after they had
all arrived, they sat down there in council.</p>

<p>The first thing Stuyvesant wished to learn
from them was exactly how much land they had
sold to the Swedes.</p>

<p>The Indians told him they had not sold any
land to the Swedes, except that upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Fort Christina stood, and ground enough around
it for a garden to plant tobacco in.</p>

<p>“Then will you sell the land to us?” asked
Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>The Indians were quite willing to do this.
They were always willing to sell anything, even
if they had already sold it; but what they wished
to know was what the Dutch would give. The
price finally agreed upon was, if they had only
known it, an absurd price indeed; but the
Indians were quite content with it. It was;—12
coats of duffels (a kind of cloth), 12 kettles,
12 axes, 12 adzes, 24 knives, 12 bars of lead and
4 guns with some powder; besides this, the
Dutch to repair the gun of the Chief Penomennetta
when it was out of order, and to give the
Indians a few handfuls of maize when they needed
it. This was the price for which the Indians
sold to the Dutch all the land along the Delaware
River, from Fort Christiana to Bombay
Hook.</p>

<p>The Indians then went away, very much pleased.
Governor Stuyvesant, too, was in high good
humor. Now he would show Printz who was
the real owner of the land.</p>

<p>In the year 1651, Stuyvesant set about having
a fort built at New Amstel, (now New Castle)
about five miles south of Fort Christina. The
name of it was to be Fort Casimir.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This fort
was of great value to the Dutch, and Stuyvesant
felt that he had taken the first step toward
recovering Dutch possession of the Delaware.</p>

<p>Printz, as soon as he knew what Stuyvesant
was about, protested against the building of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fort; but he was not strong enough to prevent it.
He had grown very unpopular, because of his
violent and coarse temper. He was hated not
only by the Dutch and the English, but by his
own people as well. Things began to grow
more and more unpleasant for him, so that at
last he begged to be allowed to go back to Sweden;
and in 1653 he left the shores of New Sweden
and his house on Tinnicum Island, and sailed
away not to return.</p>

<p>But Stuyvesant was well pleased. He felt
that it was he, with his building of Fort Casimir,
who had driven the Swede away. He smiled
comfortably to himself as he sat smoking his
pipe, and made fresh plans.</p>

<p>But in June, 1654, news came to Governor
Stuyvesant that made him leap from his chair
and clench his hands and stamp up and down
as though he would break his wooden-silver leg
to pieces. <i>The Swedes had taken Fort Casimir!</i>
And they had taken it without a single blow
having been struck by the Dutch. The taking
of the fort was in this way:—</p>

<p>Rysing, the new Swedish governor, had arrived
at Godwin Bay early in May. He came
sailing up the South River in the good ship
<i>Aren</i>, and with him came a number of new settlers,
bold and resolute men, about two or three
hundred in all.</p>

<p>As they came near Fort Casimir they fired a
royal salute, dropped their sails, and anchored.
This was May 31, 1654. Gerritt Bikker, the
commander of the fort, immediately sent to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their business in these waters. Bikker was a
very weak and timid man.</p>

<p>The messengers soon returned, bringing word
that it was a Swedish ship with the new Governor,
and that he demanded to have Fort Casimir
handed over to him, as it was on Swedish land.</p>

<p>Bikker was amazed at this message, and was
about to write out an answer when he was told
that a boat from the Swedish vessel was coming
toward the Fort, with about twenty men.</p>

<p>Bikker thought that they were bringing some
further message, and politely went down to the
beach to meet them. The gate of the fort was
left open.</p>

<p>The Swedes landed; but, instead of stopping
on the beach, they marched straight to the open
gate and into the fort. Then, drawing their
swords, they demanded the surrender of the fort.
At the same time two shots were fired from the
Swedish vessel, and the Swedes in the fort
wrenched the muskets from the hands of the
Dutch soldiers. The whole thing was so sudden
that the Dutch were unable to make any resistance,
and in a moment they had been chased
from the fort, and the Swedes had taken possession
of everything.</p>

<p>All this happened on Trinity Sunday, so the
Swedes now changed the name of the fort from
Fort Casimir, to Fort Trinity.</p>

<p>The Dutch living near the fort, took the oath
of allegiance to the Swedish crown, and it seemed
that Stuyvesant was to lose everything he had
just gained in Delaware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It was felt to be very important at this time
to gain the friendship of the Indians, so, very
soon after the capture of Fort Casimir, Governor
Rysing asked the Delaware sachems to come to a
meeting at Printz Hall.</p>

<p>The Indians came to Tinnicum Island in answer
to his message as, a short time before,
they had gone to New Amsterdam when Stuyvesant
sent for them. They were seated in the
great hall of the house and waited gravely to
hear “a talk made to them.”</p>

<p>Rysing began by telling the Indians how much
the Swedes respected them. He reminded them
of the gifts they had received from the Swedes—many
more than the Dutch had ever given them.</p>

<p>The Indians replied that the Swedes had
brought much evil upon them; that many
of them had died since the Swedes had come
into the country.</p>

<p>Rysing then gave them some presents, and
after that the Indians arose and went out.</p>

<p>Presently they returned; and the principal
sachem, a chief called Naaman, “made a talk.”
He began by saying that the Indians had done
wrong in speaking evil of the Swedes; “for the
Swedes,” said he, “are a good people; see the
presents they have brought us; for these they ask
our friendship.” He then stroked his arm three
times from the shoulder down, which among the
Indians, is a sign of friendship. He promised
that the friendship between the Indians and the
Swedes should be as close as it had been in Governor
Printz’s time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Swedes and the Indians then,” he said,
“were as one body and one heart” (and he
stroked his breast as he spoke), “and now they
shall be as one head,” and he seized his head with
both hands and then made a motion as though
he were tying a strong knot.</p>

<p>Rysing answered that this should indeed be a
strong and lasting friendship, and then the
great guns of the fort were fired.</p>

<p>The Indians were delighted at the noise and
cried, “Hoo, hoo, hoo; mockirick pickon!”
which means, “Hear and believe! The great
guns have spoken.”</p>

<p>After more talk great kettles were brought
into the hall filled with <i>sappawn</i>, a kind of hasty
pudding made of Indian corn, and all sat down
and fed heartily, and then the Indians departed
to their villages.</p>

<p>Rysing had thought that as soon as Stuyvesant
heard that the Swedes had taken Fort
Casimir, he would try to recapture it; but day
after day and week after week passed peacefully
by. Rysing began to believe that Stuyvesant
meant to let the matter rest.</p>

<p>But the hot-tempered Dutchman had far
other ideas than that. He still remembered that
he had been told to keep peace with his neighbors,
but he wrote an account of the whole matter
to the West India Company at home. Then
he had to gather together all his patience and
wait, for an answer from across the ocean.
What he most feared was that he would be told
still to keep the peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>But when Stuyvesant’s letter telling how the
Swedes had taken Fort Casimir reached Holland,
the people were aroused at last. The roll
of drums sounded in the streets of old Amsterdam.
Volunteers were called for. A ship,
<i>The Balance</i>, was fitted out with men, arms,
ammunition and provisions, and set sail as
quickly as possible for New Netherlands.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of Stuyvesant to receive
such an answer as this. He too had called for
volunteers, and he had gathered together all the
vessels he could; he had even hired a French
frigate, <i>L’Esperance</i>, which happened to be lying
in the harbor of New Amsterdam at that time.</p>

<p>About the middle of August, 1655, the little
Dutch fleet sailed out from the harbor of New
Amsterdam-seven vessels in all and carrying
almost seven hundred men. Stuyvesant himself
was in command.</p>

<p>They sailed down to the Delaware Bay, in between
the capes, and up the river to a short distance
above the fort. Quietly as Styuvesant
had moved, the Indians had learned his plans
some time before, and had carried the news of
them to Rysing.</p>

<p>Rysing had immediately sent what men and
ammunition he could spare to Fort Trinity,
and had told Captain Sven Schute, its commander,
to fire on the Dutch if they attempted to
sail past the fort. This, Sven Schute did not do.
He allowed the Dutch to pass by without firing
a single shot, and so all communication with
Fort Christina was cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuyvesant landed the Dutch soldiers on
Sunday, September 5, 1655, and sent Captain
Smith with a drummer to the fort to demand
that Captain Schute should surrender it, as it
was Dutch property.</p>

<p>Schute, however, asked time to consider, and
also to be allowed to write to Rysing.</p>

<p>This was refused; and Schute was again called
upon to surrender, and so spare the shedding of
innocent blood.</p>

<p>A second time he refused, and a third time he
was asked to surrender; and the third time he
agreed and opened his gates to the Dutch. So it
was that within a short time after leaving New
Amsterdam, the Dutch marched to the fort with
music playing and banners flying; and so, a
second time, Fort Casimir (then Fort Trinity)
was captured without a blow having been struck
or a drop of blood shed.</p>

<p>After capturing Fort Casimir, Stuyvesant
sailed up the river to Fort Christina and surrounded
it. Rysing had only thirty men, and
around him camped almost seven hundred Dutchmen.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant sent him a message by an Indian,
bidding him surrender the fort.</p>

<p>Rysing, by the same Indian, returned a letter
begging Stuyvesant to meet him and talk the
matter over.</p>

<p>This Stuyvesant agreed to; but he treated
Rysing in such an insolent way that it made
matters harder than ever for the Swedish governor
to bear. Rysing laid before him all the
Swedish claims to the river, and begged him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
withdraw his soldiers. This, Stuyvesant refused
to do, and again demanded the surrender
of the fort.</p>

<p>Rysing would not agree to this and so returned.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth of September all the
Dutch guns were turned upon Fort Christina,
and Rysing was again called upon to surrender.</p>

<p>This time, seeing how useless it was to try to
defend the fort with his small force, he agreed.
Such terms as he could, he made with the Dutch.</p>

<p>He and his troops were allowed to march out
with drums beating, fifes playing, and colors
flying, and they were also allowed to keep their
guns and ammunition and all effects belonging
to the Swedish Crown. It was agreed that no
Swedes were to be kept there against their will;
but any were to be allowed to stay one year if
they wished, in order to arrange their affairs.
Rysing and his Swedes were also to have a ship
to take them back to Gottenburg in Sweden.</p>

<p>Thus, on September 25, 1655, our state became
the property of the Dutch, and Swedish
power ended forever on the banks of the Delaware.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>IT WAS in the year 1682, and Delaware had
seen many changes since Peter Minuit and
his little band of Swedes had landed on her
wild shores. During those years the Swedes
had been driven out by the Dutch, and the Dutch
had afterward surrendered to the English; then
the Dutch, growing stronger, had driven out the
English; but again the English had taken possession
and now owned all of what had once been
New Netherlands and New Sweden. New
Netherlands was now called New York, and it
was the English Directors, (living in the town
of New York, formerly New Amsterdam), who
made the laws for Delaware.</p>

<p>Only a few English, however, had come to
Delaware to live. The people of Wilmington
(once Christinaham, or Christina Harbor) and of
New Castle, were principally Dutch and Swedes.
They were simple farmer people, raising crops
and cattle and chickens, and they were very
willing to keep the laws that the English at New
York made for them. The Indians were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
troublesome at times, but the settlers had their
block-houses or forts to retreat to and were
generally able to protect themselves.</p>

<p>But now it had come to their ears that a new
governor was coming out from England to rule
over them, and they wondered anxiously what
sort of man he would prove to be. Governor
Printz had been coarse and violent; Governor
Stuyvesant, hot-tempered, ambitious, and overbearing;
and terrible tales had been told of the
cruelty of Governor Kieft. There had been a
long line of governors since Minuit’s time, both
in Delaware and in New York; and few of them
had seemed to care for the good of the poorer
people. And now this new man was coming
and, for all they knew, might be the worst of all.</p>

<p>The name of the new Governor was William
Penn. The Duke of York had given Delaware
to him, and King Charles the Second, had given
him a great tract of land farther to the North,
which he called Pennsylvania. More than this,
the people did not know; but they often talked
about the new governor and wondered what he
would be like, and when he would come, as they
sat around their fires in the early fall evenings.</p>

<p>Then they began to learn more about him;
for his cousin, Captain William Markham, came
out to America to act as Governor till Penn could
come himself. They learned that Penn belonged
to the Quakers—a strange, new religious sect;
and that it was the rule that Quakers must dress
very plainly and say “thee” and “thou” to
people instead of “you” and take off their hats
to nobody, not even the King himself. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
seemed a strange thing indeed to the settlers,
and they wondered how the King liked it.</p>

<p>Penn had bought the land from King Charles,
and his brother the Duke for an absurd price—a
price so small that the poorest farmer among
them all might have bought it if he had had the
chance.</p>

<p>For all of Pennsylvania, with its wooded hills
and fertile valleys and well-stocked streams, he
had paid only twelve shillings<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, at Michaelmas,
was to pay the King five shillings more.</p>

<p>For Delaware, he had paid ten shillings to the
Duke of York; and every Michaelmas he was to
pay to the Duke, a rose. He was also to pay
over one half of the profits he drew from the
southern part of Delaware. Yes, any of the
honest farmers might have bought the land at
that price, but then, the great people most
probably would not have sold it at all to anyone
but their friend, William Penn.</p>

<p>Captain Markham was buying for Penn, from
the Indians such rights as they had in the land,
and was paying them well—better than they
had ever been paid before—so perhaps the new
governor was a generous, fair minded man after
all.</p>

<p>So, in talk and wonderings, the days slipped
by. September had passed, and October was
almost gone, before the governor’s English ship,
the <i>Welcome</i>, was sighted coming up the river
from the bay. The news of its coming spread
from house to house, and from farm to farm,
and even back into the country to the villages of
the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>All work was laid aside, and the people of
New Castle and the country round about gathered
down at the shore to watch the approach of
the vessel. Captain Markham himself was
there, gorgeous in his English uniform, having
come down to New Castle to meet his cousin.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the ship, looming up
bigger and bigger, stately and slow, its sails
spread wide, and the English colors fluttering at
its masthead. Then it came about, and the
great anchor dropped into the water with a
splash. Boats were lowered, and the people of
the vessel clambered down into them and were
rowed toward the shore. In the very first boat
came William Penn himself.</p>

<p>He was a tall, noble looking man, with large,
dark, kindly eyes, and hair that fell in loose locks
to his shoulders. He was very simply dressed,
as were all the men with him. The only way in
which his dress differed from theirs was that he
wore a light blue silken sash around his waist.
He was worn and thin, and some of his companions
looked even ill.</p>

<p>This was not to be wondered at, for he told
his cousin that soon after they had set sail from
England, smallpox had broken out on board the
<i>Welcome</i>. Of the one hundred men who had
started with him, almost one-third had died on
the voyage. The colonists heard afterward of
the goodness of William Penn to the sick. He
himself had never had smallpox, but everyday
during the voyage he went down to the bedsides
of the sufferers. He gave them medicines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
talked with them and cheered them, and ministered
to the dying.</p>

<p>It had indeed been a terrible voyage. Fortunately,
the ship had been well stocked with
provisions of every kind, and many luxuries.<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Still, these could ease but little the sufferings of
the sick, shut up for two months in that rolling,
tossing vessel. A blessed sight the shores and
wooded hills of Delaware must have been to
those sick and weary voyagers.</p>

<p>As Penn landed, Captain Markham came forward
eagerly to greet him. It was a strange and
varied crowd that had gathered there to meet
their governor—Swedes, Dutch, Germans and
Welsh, many of them dressed in their national
costumes, and back of them the tall, red skinned
Indian, Sachem Taminent, with his party of
Leni Lenapes in their paint and feathers.</p>

<p>Penn was escorted by his cousin and the principal
men of the village, to the house that had
been made ready for him, there to eat and rest
after his long journey.</p>

<p>The next day, October 28, 1682, the new
governor went to the Courthouse to speak to
the people. The room was thronged with those
who crowded in to hear him. Before he began,
however, two gentlemen, John Moll and Ephraim
Herman, performed what is called “livery of
seisin;” that is, they gave to Penn earth, water,
a piece of turf, and a twig, in token that he was
ruler there of land and water and of the fruits of
tree and field.</p>

<p>After that, Penn spoke to the people with
such kindness, that their simple hearts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
filled with joy. He bade them remember that
they were “but as little children in the wilderness,”
and under the care of one Father. He told
them that he wished to found a free and virtuous
state in which the people should learn to rule
themselves. He promised that every man in his
provinces should “enjoy liberty of conscience,”
and have a voice in the ruling of the colony.</p>

<p>The people listened to him in deep silence; and
when he ended his speech, they had but one
thing to beg of him, and that was that he would
stay among them at New Castle and rule over
them. This he told them he could not do; and
then they begged him to join their territory to
Pennsylvania, that the white settlers might
have one country and one ruler. He promised
to consider this, and then he bade them good-bye
and returned to the ship.</p>

<p>The sails of the vessel were spread wide like
great wings of peace, the wind filled them,
and slowly the ship began to move. The colonists
upon the shore still lingered there, gazing
after her, and straining their eyes to see, as long
as they could, the tall man that stood there in
the stem with a light blue sash around his waist
At last they could see him no longer, and then
they turned and went back to their daily toil.</p>

<p>Penn did not forget them or his promise to
them. At the first General Assembly held at
Chester, it was declared that the two provinces
were united, and that the laws that governed one
should be for the other too.</p>

<p>In 1701, Penn visited New Castle again and
was received with joy by its people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>A few years later he made the town a gift of
one thousand acres of land lying to the north of
it, to be used as a public commons by its people
and to belong to them.</p>

<p>This tract of land still belongs to the town of
New Castle, but since 1792 it has been rented
out in farms, and is no longer a public commons.</p>

<p>William Penn did much to bring the Indians
into truer friendship with the settlers. He
treated them justly. He trusted them and
went among them unarmed and unprotected.
He walked with them, attended their meetings
and ate of their hominy and roasted acorns.
One time it happened the Indians were showing
him how they could hop and jump, and after
sitting watching them for a time, the Governor
rose up and out-jumped them all.</p>

<p>Penn’s word was trusted by Indians and
settlers alike, and they knew their interests were
as safe in his hands as in their own.<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>New Castle has just cause for pride in the fact
that William Penn’s first landing in America
was made upon her shore.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_14" id="Footnote_3_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_14">[3]</a> Among the articles used in trading with the natives was rum.
The colonists at that time did not seem to see how dangerous it
was to let them have it. Several years later, however, the
Friends (Quakers) had a meeting with the natives, in order to
put a stop to the sale of rum, brandy, and other liquors. There
were eight Sachems present, and one of them made this speech.</p>

<p>“The strong liquor was first sold us by the Dutch, and they are
blind, they had no eyes, they did not see it was for our hurt.
The next people that came among us were the Swedes, and they
too sold strong liquors to us; they were also blind, they had no
eyes, they did not see it was hurtful to us to drink it, although we
knew it was hurtful to us; but if people will sell it to us we are so
in love with it that we cannot forbear. When we drink it, it
makes us mad; we do not know what we do; we then abuse one
another, we throw each other into the fire; seven score of our
people have been killed by reason of drinking it. But now there
is a people come to live among us that have eyes, they see it be
for our hurt, and are willing to deny themselves the profit of it
for our good. Now the cask must be sealed up, it must not leak
by day or night, in light or in the dark, and we give you these
four belts of wampum to be witnesses of this agreement.” One
bargain made with the Indians, included the gift of one hundred
jew’s-harps.</p></div>

<p class='dropcapstory'>YEARS passed, and the Counties
on the Delaware,<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> under
the wise laws of William
Penn,<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> grew and prospered. Dover
was laid out and settled; New
Castle flourished; Lewes became a town. Instead
of the rough buildings of the early settlers,
handsome country houses and comfortable farms
were to be seen.</p>

<p>The manners and customs of the people were
still very plain and simple. Very few foreign
articles were used in this part of the country.
Clothes were woven, cut and sewed at home.
Beef, pork, poultry, milk, butter, cheese, wheat
and Indian corn were raised on the farms; the
fruit trees yielded freely, and there was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
deal of wild game; the people lived not only comfortably
but luxuriously.<a name="FNanchor_3_17" id="FNanchor_3_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_17" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Counties on the Delaware were very fertile,
and very little labor was needed to make the
land yield all that was required. The people had
a great deal of leisure time for visiting and pleasure.
They were always gathering together at
one house or another, the younger people to
dance or frolic, and the older men to amuse themselves
with wrestling, running races, jumping,
throwing the disc and other rustic and manly
exercises.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve there was a universal
firing of guns, and all through the holidays the
people traveled from house to house, feasting and
eating Twelfth cake, and playing games.<a name="FNanchor_4_18" id="FNanchor_4_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_18" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>So for years, life slipped pleasantly by in these
southern Counties, and then suddenly there
came a change. There began to be talk of war
with England. News was eagerly watched for.
There was no mail at that time. Letters were
carried by stage-coach, or by messengers riding
on horseback from town to town. In the old
days, the people had been content to send their
servants for letters. Now, when a messenger,
hot and dusty, came galloping into the town, a
crowd would be waiting, and would gather round
him.</p>

<p>And it was thrilling news that the dusty
messengers carried in those days, the days of
1775. England was determined to tax her
colonies, and the colonies were rising in rebellion.
Boston had thrown whole cargoes of tea into her
harbor rather than pay the tax on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the first shots of the Revolution were
fired at Concord and Lexington. At the sound
of those shots the Counties on Delaware awoke.
Drums were beat, muskets were cleaned, ladies
sewed flags for the troops to carry; men enlisted,
and the militia drilled. But still it was hoped
by many that things would settle back peaceably.</p>

<p>But worse and worse news came from the
north. Boston harbor had been shut up by the
English. The people were starving. War ships
from England had brought over more troops
(many of them hired Germans), and had quartered
them on the town. All the country was
hot with anger over these things. Food and
clothing were sent to Boston. General Washington
raised troops of a thousand men, at his
own expense, and marched north to her relief.</p>

<p>General Caesar Rodney was one of the important
men of Dover at that time. He was a tall,
pale, strange looking man, with flashing eyes,
and a face, as we are told, “no larger than a good
sized apple.” He was a general in the militia,
and was heart and soul for independence. He
rode about the country, calling meetings, speaking
to the people, and urging them to enlist, and
urging them, too, to raise money to give to the
government. He was at this time suffering from
a painful disease, but he spared neither strength
nor comfort in the cause of freedom.</p>

<p>Mr. George Read of New Castle, was a very
important man in the colonies, too. He was a
patriot, and belonged to the militia, but he was
very anxious not to begin a war. He argued
that England had spent a great deal of money on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
her American colonies, and that she had a right
to try to get some of it back by taxing them.
He agreed that the time might come when the
colonies would have to be free, but he thought
that time had not yet come. He hoped that
when it did, the colonies might win their freedom
peaceably, and not by battle and bloodshed.
He was a calm, quiet, learned man, rather slow of
speech, and different in many ways from his
quick and fiery friend, Rodney.</p>

<p>A third man who was important in Colonial
times was Mr. Thomas McKean. He was a
lawyer in New Castle, and was a friend of both
these men. Like Rodney, he was for freedom at
any cost.</p>

<p>In 1776, when the Colonial Congress was called
to meet in Philadelphia, these three men, Rodney,
Read and McKean, were sent to it as delegates
by the Counties on the Delaware.<a name="FNanchor_5_19" id="FNanchor_5_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_19" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This meeting of Congress in the summer of
1776 was the most important meeting that had
ever been held. From north and south the
delegates came riding to it, from all the thirteen
colonies; and they met in the Committee Room
of the State House in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Many serious questions were to be decided by
these delegates this year. But the most serious
of all the questions was whether the Colonies
should declare themselves free and independent
states. If they did this, it would mean war with
England.</p>

<p>While the question was still being argued
about in the committee room, Caesar Rodney
was sent for to come back to the Counties on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Delaware. Riots and quarrels and disturbances
had broken out there, and no one could quiet
them as well as Caesar Rodney. He was very
glad to go, for it seemed as though it might be a
long time before the delegates would decide on
anything, and he hoped to be able to raise some
money for the government.</p>

<p>He started out early one morning on horseback,
cantering easily along through the cool of
the day. It was eighty miles from Philadelphia
to Dover, and he broke it by stopping over night
at New Castle, which was rather more than half
way home. The road he took was the old King’s
Highroad, which ran on down through the
Counties on Delaware, through Wilmington and
New Castle and Dover, as far as Lewes.</p>

<p>General Rodney found a great deal to do down
in the Counties. The Whigs and Tories had
come to blows. One Tory gentleman only just
escaped being tarred and feathered, and carried
on a rail. Caesar Rodney was the one who had
to quiet all the troubles. Beside this he made
speeches, raised moneys and helped get together
fresh troops of militia.</p>

<p>But busy though he was, he managed to find
some time for visiting about among his friends.
Especially he found time to visit at the house of a
young Quaker widow named Sarah Rowland.
Mistress Rowland lived in Lewes. She was a
Tory, but she was very beautiful and witty, and
Caesar Rodney was said to be in love with her.
He might often have been seen, between his busy
times, cantering along the road that led to Lewes
and to her house. Mistress Rowland, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Quaker, believed all fighting to be wrong, but
she was always friendly with the General. Perhaps
she hoped in some way to be able to help the
Tories by things the General told her, or by having
him at her house. At any rate she always
made him welcome.</p>

<p>Now, while General Rodney was still busy
down in the Counties on the Delaware, with his
work and pleasure, great things were happening
in Philadelphia. The Declaration of Independence
was finally drawn up and written out.</p>

<p>It was laid on the table before the Colonial
Congress, and the delegates were given five days
to make up their minds to agree, whether they
would sign it or not. They considered and discussed
it in secret behind closed doors.</p>

<p>One after another, the delegates from various
colonies agreed to sign. At last, only the Counties
on the Delaware were needed to carry the
agreement. They could not sign the Declaration,
for they had now only two delegates present
at Congress. Of these, one (McKean) was for it,
and one (Mr. Read) was against it, so it was a
tie between them, and Rodney, whose vote could
have decided the matter, was down in the Counties
on Delaware, eighty miles away.</p>

<p>McKean was in despair. He sent message
after message, down to Delaware, begging the
General to return to Philadelphia and give his
deciding vote, but no answer came. The fact
was that General Rodney did not receive any of
these messages McKean sent. He was visiting
Mistress Rowland in Lewes at the time, and she
managed to keep the letters back from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
She hoped that he might know nothing about the
Declaration until it had been voted on and the
whole matter decided. Even if all the other
Colonies decided to sign, it would weaken the
union very much if the Colonies on the Delaware
did not sign.</p>

<p>On the third of July, McKean sent a last message
down to Rodney, passionately begging him
to come to Philadelphia. The vote of the delegates
was to be taken July the fourth, and if the
General was not there the vote of the Counties on
Delaware could not be cast for the Declaration of
Independence, and it might be lost.</p>

<p>On this same day, July the third, 1776, Caesar
Rodney was chatting with Mistress Rowland in
the parlor of her house at Lewes. It had seemed
strange to him that he had not heard from
McKean lately, but he felt sure that if anything
important was happening at Philadelphia he
would receive word at once. So he put his
anxieties aside and laughed and talked with
the widow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the parlor door was thrown open
and a maid-servant came into the room. She
crossed over to where General Rodney was
sitting. “There!” she cried. “I’m an honest
girl and I won’t keep those back any longer!”
and she threw a packet of letters into the General’s
lap.</p>

<p>Rodney picked them up and looked at them.
They were in Mr. McKean’s hand-writing.
Hastily he ran through them. They were the
letters Sarah Rowland had been keeping back,—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
letters begging and imploring him to hasten
north to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Without a word, General Rodney started to
his feet, and ran out to where his horse was
standing before the house.<a name="FNanchor_6_20" id="FNanchor_6_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_20" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Sarah Rowland
called to him, but he did not heed her. He
sprang to the saddle and gathered up the reins,
and a moment later he was galloping madly
north toward Dover. It was a long ride, but a
longer still was before him. The heat was
stifling, and the dust rose in clouds as he thundered
along the King’s Highroad.</p>

<p>At Dover, he stopped to change his horse, and
here he was met by McKean’s last messenger,
with a letter, urging him to haste, haste. Indeed,
there was not an hour to waste. Philadelphia
was eighty miles away, and the vote was
to be taken the next morning.</p>

<p>On went Rodney on his fresh horse. Daylight
was gone. The moon sailed slowly up the sky,
and the trees were clumps of blackness on either
hand as he rode.</p>

<p>At Chester, he again changed horses, but he
did not stop for either rest or food. Soon, he
was riding on again.</p>

<p>It was in the morning of July fourth, that the
rider, exhausted and white with dust, drew rein
before the State House door in Philadelphia.
McKean was there watching for him.</p>

<p>“Am I in time?” called Rodney as he swung
himself from his horse.</p>

<p>“In time, but no more,” answered McKean.</p>

<p>Side by side he and Rodney entered Independence
Hall. There sat the delegates in a semi-circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Rodney and McKean took their places.
The Declaration of Independence lay on the
table before them. It was being voted on. One
after the other the colonies were called on and
one after another they gave their votes for it.
The Counties on Delaware were called on.
Mr. McKean rose and voted for it. Mr. Read
was, as usual against it.</p>

<p>Then Caesar Rodney rose in his place. His
face looked white and worn under its dust, but he
spoke in a clear, firm voice. “I vote for Independence.”</p>

<p>And so the day was won. From the belfry of
Independence Hall, the bells pealed out over the
Quaker City. Bonfires blazed out, people shouted
for joy, and the thirteen American Colonies,
strong in union, stood pledged together for
liberty.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE little town of Lewes is on Delaware
Bay, with rolling dunes of sand between
it and the ocean. The winds that blow
over it have the smell and taste of salt in
them, and in the sky overhead, the grey seagulls
soar and hover.</p>

<p>There was a time, long ago, when pirates sailed
the Delaware waters. Sometimes they landed
there, and drank and plundered and put the
people in fear of their lives. There is a story
that Captain Kidd buried much treasure somewhere
among these dunes.</p>

<p>But that was long before the American colonies
went to war with England, and in Revolutionary
times it was not pirates that Lewes was
afraid of, but English warships.</p>

<p>From Delaware Bay the Delaware River lies,
wide and open, all the way to Philadelphia. An
enemy’s ship that entered the bay could easily
sail on up the bay and river, past New Castle,
Wilmington and Chester,—and might bombard
Philadelphia from the water-front. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
what the Committee of Safety feared the British
would do when the Revolutionary War began, so
a guard was set at Henlopen light house.</p>

<p>It was in the last week of March of the year
1776, that the first British war vessel entered
Delaware Bay. This vessel was a frigate called
“Roebuck.” She came sailing slowly in, the
black mouths of her guns threatening the town,
and anchored in the bay. Her tender followed
her, and she too was armed with guns.</p>

<p>Then all Lewes was in a stir. Messengers were
sent riding in hot haste to Philadelphia, and all
along the way they spread the news that the
British ships had arrived. Colonel John Haslet
came marching down to Lewes at the head of the
Delaware militia, so as to be ready to protect the
town against the English, in case they tried to land.</p>

<p>This, however, the British did not try to do.
They cruised up and down in the “Roebuck,”
or lay at anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>They managed to capture a pilot boat named
the “Alarm,” near Lewes, and they fitted her out
as a second tender. A little later they made a
prize of an American sloop called the “Plymouth.”
All the men from the tender were put
on board this new prize except a lieutenant and
three soldiers who were still left on the “Alarm,”
to take care of her. But that night the helmsman
on the “Alarm” fell asleep; the boat drifted
on shore, and the lieutenant and his men were
taken prisoner by the Americans.</p>

<p>There had as yet been no shots exchanged between
the Americans and the English. But
one bright, clear Sunday morning in April, word
was brought to Colonel Haslet that an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
schooner had anchored just off the shore below
Cape Henlopen. The captain wished him to
send men to help unload her. She carried supplies
for the Americans.</p>

<p>Unluckily, news of the schooner reached the
British, too, and at the same time that Haslet’s
men started by land to help the captain unload,
the British tender started by sea.</p>

<p>The Americans made all the haste they could,
but they were obliged to cross a creek before they
could reach the place where the schooner lay.
The country people brought boats and ferried
them over, but the soldiers soon saw that the
tender was out-racing them.</p>

<p>The captain of the schooner saw this, too, and
rather than have his cargo fall into the hands of
the British, he set his sails, and ran ashore.</p>

<p>As soon as the American soldiers arrived they
began to fire at the tender, but she kept too far
away for their bullets to reach her. Seeing this,
they laid aside their muskets and set to work to
help the sailors unload the schooner.</p>

<p>The tender kept firing at them all the while
they were unloading, but her shots fell harmlessly
in the sand. Several of the soldiers picked
up the balls as they fell, and carried them home
to show to their families.</p>

<p>The tender now sent a barge back to summon
the “Roebuck,” and presently, the frigate came
sailing around the Cape at full speed to help
the tender. She swept down toward the schooner
like a great bird, but presently she found she
was running into shoal water. She was obliged
to come to anchor just off the Hen-and-Chicken
shoals, but from there she began to fire at the
soldiers and the schooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The Americans now turned the schooner’s
guns on the frigate and tender. They saw a
gunner on the frigate throw up his arms and fall.
A number of the English were wounded, but not
a single American was hurt. Presently, the
frigate, finding it a losing game, sailed back
around the Cape and out of reach.</p>

<p>No more shots were exchanged between the
English and American vessels until May. Early
in that month the “Roebuck” was joined by the
sloop “Liverpool,” and the two with their tenders
sailed straight up the bay and river toward
Wilmington. Then they moved to and fro, between
Chester and New Castle.</p>

<p>News of their coming went before them. At
New Castle, houses were closed, and the people
loaded their goods in wagons and carriages and
fled back into the country.</p>

<p>At Wilmington, a number of row-galleys (some
thirteen in number) were gathered and furnished
with guns and ammunition, and were
made ready in every way to give battle to the
enemy. The galleys were under the command
of Captain Houston, of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the eighth of May,
that the British sails were seen coming up the
river. Great crowds of people had gathered on
the banks to watch the battle.</p>

<p>It was not until the British vessels were almost
opposite Christiana creek that the firing began.
The dull boom of the guns echoed and re-echoed
from the wooded hills of the Brandywine. Great
puffs of grey smoke drifted across the water.
Sometimes the vessels were almost hidden.</p>

<p>In the midst of the battle, four Wilmington
boys started out from the shore, armed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
some old muskets that they had somehow got
hold of. They boldly rowed out through the
smoke until they were directly under the stern of
the “Liverpool,” and then they began to fire at
her. Presently, an officer on the sloop saw them.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he called to his commanding
officer, “do you see those young rebels? Shall I
fire on them?”</p>

<p>The brave old Captain Bellew shook his head.
“No, no,” he cried; “don’t hurt the boys. Let
them break the cabin windows if they want to.”</p>

<p>That indeed, was about all the damage the
young patriots were able to do. When they had
used up their ammunition, they rowed back to
the shore again unhurt.</p>

<p>While the firing was still at the hottest, a
major of artillery came riding at full speed. He
threw himself from his horse, and begged a couple
of boatmen who were standing with the crowd,
to row him out to the galleys; he wished to
have a chance to fire a shot at the enemy.</p>

<p>The boatmen refused. They were afraid they
might get shot, but when the major promised
them a handful of money they changed their
minds and agreed to row to the nearest galley.</p>

<p>As soon as the major was on board the boat, he
stationed himself at a gun and began to fire it off,
and as he proved to be a very good shot he was
allowed to stay there. After a while he called
for more ammunition, but was told that it had all
been used. The gallant officer pulled off his
boots, filled them with powder, rammed them
into the gun and fired it for the last time. In
after life his boast was that he had not only been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in the first naval battle of the war, but that he
had fired his boots at the enemy.</p>

<p>On all the galleys the officers showed the greatest
bravery. The British had at first looked
with contempt at the open boats that had come
to fight them. It did not take many shots, however,
to teach them that these American galleys
were not to be despised.</p>

<p>A part of the “Roebuck’s” rigging was shot
away and her sides were badly damaged by the
balls. Finally, in trying to get nearer to the
galleys she ran aground, near the mouth of the
Christiana creek. She now keeled over in such a
way that she could no longer use her guns.
Night came and she still lay there, unable to get
off into deep water, or to right herself. The
great fear of her men was that the galleys might
come to attack her while she lay there helpless,
so they sent out three small boats and kept them
circling around her all night to watch out for an
attack. If the Americans had come, it was the
plan of the English to fill the small boats with as
many of the “Roebuck’s” men as they could,
and send them over to the “Liverpool.” The
“Liverpool” was then to retreat down the river.
However, the night passed quietly, and at four
o’clock in the morning the water had risen so
that they were able to get the “Roebuck” off.</p>

<p>In the morning, the row-galleys returned to
the attack, though they had been very much
damaged the day before. But their men were as
determined as ever, and they had a fresh supply
of ammunition. One of their shots went clear
through the bows of the “Roebuck,” and a number
of her men were wounded. One of the
officers was killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The British now decided to retreat. Very
slowly they drew off and drifted down the river.
On their way they tried to destroy the little town
of Port Penn, but they could not get near enough
to the shore; the water was too shallow.</p>

<p>When they reached Lewes they lay there
for some time, while the ship’s carpenters mended
the holes made by the American shots. They
took on fresh water and provisions, and then
sailed out from the Delaware waters.</p>

<p>So ended the first naval battle of the Revolution;
a battle fought in Delaware waters. One
other sea fight was fought there, and it was the
last one of the war. It was between the American
sloop of war “Hyder Alley,” and the British
sloop “General Monk,” and in this, too, the British
were defeated. It was not an important
battle, but it seemed a curious chance that the
first and the last sea-fights of the Revolution
should both have been in Delaware waters.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory'>WAR had begun,—war between the
United Colonies of America, with
their small, poorly armed forces,
and England, the richest and most powerful
country in the world.</p>

<p>From all the thirteen colonies of America,
regiments marched away to join General Washington
and the little army he had already gathered
together.</p>

<p>Delaware sent her regiment with the rest.
It was under the command of Colonel John Haslet.<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Men had come from all over the state to
enlist in it. They carried whatever weapons
they could get,—rifles, carbines, muskets or
fowling pieces. A few of them had uniforms,
but some of them had not even coats, and so
came in their shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>The regiment set out from Dover to the sound
of fife and drum. Their flag waved gaily over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
them and the people crowded the streets, and
waved and cheered to see them go.</p>

<p>It was a long, hot march from Dover up to
New York, where General Washington was encamped.
The soldiers soon grew footsore and
weary, marching, as they did, from early dawn
till night. Sometimes when they passed a
stream they broke ranks to kneel on its bank and
drink the cool, running water. Sometimes the
farmers came out and handed them summer
fruits and vegetables as they passed, and as they
went through the towns the people cheered and
waved their handkerchiefs to them.</p>

<p>At last they reached New York, but they
had no sooner arrived than the whole regiment
was ordered to cross the river and join General
Stirling’s brigade in Brooklyn. Stirling was
expecting an attack from the British at any
time, and he needed all the troops he could get.</p>

<p>Before the regiment had left Delaware, Colonel
Haslet had begun to drill them, and as soon as
they were settled in Brooklyn the drill began
again. The men were kept at it until their bones
ached and they were ready to drop with weariness,
but it was this constant drilling that
brought the Delaware regiment into shape, and
afterward won for it the name of “the picked
regiment of the Colonial Army.”</p>

<p>One evening when the men were resting
around the fires, one of their comrades came out
from a tent carrying two game-cocks by the legs.
Somehow he had managed to bring them up from
Delaware with him. They were of a bluish grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
color, and were of a breed well known in Kent
County, and called “<i>Blue Game Chickens</i>.”</p>

<p>When the soldiers saw the two cocks they
shouted for joy. “A chicken-fight! A chicken-fight!”
they cried. “We’ll have a chicken-fight.
Where did you get them Bill?”</p>

<p>Bill threw the cocks into the middle of the
ring. For a moment they stood looking about
with their bright eyes. Then they lowered their
heads and ruffled their feathers. The next
moment they flew at each other and fought
furiously but before they could injure each other
they were separated and shut up in boxes.</p>

<p>“That’s the way we’ve got to fight,” cried Bill.
“We’re sons of the old Blue Hen, and we’re
game to the end.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we are,” shouted the others.
“We’re the <i>Blue Hen’s Chickens</i>, the fighting
breed.” And from that night that was the name
by which the plucky Delaware regiment went—<i>The
Blue Hen’s Chickens</i>.</p>

<p>The Delaware regiment<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was soon to prove
its courage. It was August twenty-seventh,
about five days after they had arrived in Brooklyn,
that they first went under fire.</p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth, General Stirling had
received news that the next morning the British
meant to attack his forces. They would begin
the attack very early.</p>

<p>It was not yet light when the Delaware regiment,
shivering with excitement, was marched
out, and stationed near an orchard. In this
orchard the Maryland regiment was placed but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
just where the British troops were they did not
know.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see anything at first, but
there were sounds that made them know that
somewhere there in the darkness, the enemy was
moving and marching. Presently, a faint light
began to show in the sky. There were shots in
the distance. Then they saw through the growing
light a great dark moving mass opposite to
them. Nearer and nearer it came, and now they
could see long lines of the Hessians; the light
glittered on the brass fronts of their immense
caps.</p>

<p>They were coming!</p>

<p>The Maryland and Delaware regiments opened
fire, and here and there they saw a Hessian throw
up his arms and fall, but immediately the ranks
filled up, and on they came at a steady, quick
step. The Delaware regiment had found some
shelter behind an old fence.</p>

<p>“Fix bayonets!” There was a rattle and
clash as the bayonets of the Delawares slipped into
place. “Forward, <i>charge</i>!” Out from their
shelter sprang the Delaware soldiers. They
charged upon the Hessians, but they were met
by such a steady front that for a moment they
wavered. Then (we are told) a captain of Smallwood’s
company sprang forward and caught the
Delaware flag from the flag bearer; he flung it
over into the midst of the Hessian regiment.</p>

<p>A long roar followed as the Delaware men flung
themselves forward, mad to recover their flag.
Before that fierce rush, the Hessians wavered
and broke; they tried to recover and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
turned and fled, and again the flag of Delaware
waved over the heads of the Blue Hen’s Chickens.</p>

<p>The Maryland regiment had also charged, and
now they and the Delaware soldiers stood drawn
up on a hill. The guns of the enemy were turned
upon them, but their colors were flying. Other
regiments of the American army had been forced
to retreat, but these gallant little bands did not
think of quitting their place. At last an express
order came from the General commanding them
to retreat. Then, and not till then, they fell
back. Their flags were almost cut to pieces with
shot, but the Delaware regiment retreated in
such good order that they lost but few men.<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The Marylanders were not so lucky, as many of
them were taken prisoners or killed.</p>

<p>This victory seemed to satisfy the British for
the time. They took up their quarters in Trenton
and then they led a merry life, feasting and
drinking. They stole as they liked from all
the country round, and the poor country people
were helpless. If they resisted they were shot
down like dogs.</p>

<p>So the autumn and the first part of December
passed. Upon the other side of the river from
Trenton, the American forces were encamped.
December was bitterly cold. Many of our men
had no shoes. Food and blankets were scarce.
The men kept the fires going day and night.</p>

<p>The day before Christmas, word was passed
through the American encampment that on
Christmas morning they would cross the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and attack the English. The men cheered when
they heard that news.</p>

<p>Christmas day dawned cold and dark and
snowy. In the chill morning the men were
marched, company after company, down to the
flat boats that lay on the river, and were rowed
over to the other side. Men and horses huddled
together, trying to get some warmth from each
other. The bitter wind whistled past their ears,
and the sleet cut their faces.</p>

<p>On the Trenton side the troops were landed,
and then began a seven miles tramp through the
snow. The men struggled through the drifts,
blinded by the sleet. Their hands were almost
frozen to their muskets.</p>

<p>As they drew near the British encampment
they were halted for a rest. They stood there
in the snow, panting and leaning on their muskets.
They could hear, through the snowy air,
the ringing of the bells, and the shouts of the
British soldiers. A gun was fired. They almost
thought they heard a roar of laughter. The
British were making merry at Christmas with no
thought that their enemies were so near.</p>

<p>“Silence, and forward!”—the muffled order
passed along the line.</p>

<p>The soldiers again shouldered their muskets
and marched on. The deep drifts muffled their
footsteps and the falling snow hid them like a
curtain. Two hundred yards from the British
encampment they were formed in line and the
order rang out, “Forward, <i>charge</i>!”</p>

<p>Down upon the encampment they swept,
running, leaping, stumbling through the drifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a wild alarm in the British camp,
and a scramble for muskets, but the surprise was
too sudden for them. They could not escape,
and within half an hour the Americans had
made one thousand of them prisoners; they had
also captured one thousand muskets, and sixteen
hundred blankets. Many a poor lad, for
the first time in weeks, slept warm that Christmas
night in British blankets.</p>

<p>When the cities heard of the great victory
their army had won at Trenton, bells were rung
and bonfires were lighted; they went mad with
joy.</p>

<p>The battle of Princeton, which followed soon
after, was an even greater victory for the Americans.
But Delaware could not share in the rejoicings
that followed, for her brave regiment
was almost cut to pieces in that battle. Of the
eight hundred men who fought that day barely
one hundred were left, and Colonel Haslet was
killed by a shot through the head.</p>

<p>Washington now called for more troops, and
again Delaware gathered together a regiment
and sent it north to join him.</p>

<p>The men under Hall were with Washington in
the battle of Brandywine, when his forces were
terribly defeated, and also in the battle at Germantown;
and they went with him into winter
quarters at Valley Forge.</p>

<p>Though the troops had suffered at Trenton the
winter before, it was nothing to their sufferings
at Valley Forge. They built themselves rough
log huts, which gave them some shelter, and
they had plenty of wood to burn, but food was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
scarce. The death of a horse was hailed with
joy, for then they could have meat. Their
clothing fell into rags, and they had nothing to
sleep on but the bare earthen floors of their huts.
Washington sent out orders to all the farmers
round to thresh out their grain, and let the
soldiers have the straw to sleep on.<a name="FNanchor_4_24" id="FNanchor_4_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_24" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Almost every day the General went from hut
to hut, cheering and encouraging his soldiers as
best he could.</p>

<p>One day he saw a soldier tramping barefoot
through the snow. His foot prints were marked
with blood. Washington unfastened his cloak
and held it out to the man, “Here my poor
fellow,” he said, “tear this into strips and bind
it around your feet.”</p>

<p>The soldier refused the cloak with a laugh.
“That’s all right, General,” he said. “I don’t
need it. As long as my feet are bleeding I
know they’re not frozen.”</p>

<p>Not all of the men could bear the suffering and
hunger however. Many died, and still more
deserted. In February there were in camp only
about five thousand men able to work and carry
arms. The regiment of Delaware was among the
faithful ones who staid through it all.</p>

<p>It was with joy that the American soldiers
saw the coming of spring. On clear days they
stretched themselves out in the sun and felt
fresh life warming their bodies. Thin, sickly
and ragged, they still found strength to joke and
laugh.</p>

<p>The British troops, who had spent the winter
in Philadelphia, were in fine condition. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
had been well fed and housed, and had spent
their time in merry making and balls, while our
poor men were starving in their huts.</p>

<p>In April 1780,<a name="FNanchor_5_25" id="FNanchor_5_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_25" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> our army was again on the
move. The Delaware and Maryland regiments
were ordered south under Baron DeKalb, to join
General Greene’s army, which was fighting there.
It was in this Southern campaign that the Delaware
regiment won its greatest glory. The
Blue Hen’s Chickens were in many battles and
skirmishes, and in all they bore themselves with
the greatest bravery.</p>

<p>Then, in August, came the battle of Camden,
South Carolina. It was the battle in which the
Delaware regiment proved themselves bravest,
and the last in which they were to fight as a
separate regiment.</p>

<p>Cornwallis had determined to attack our forces
early in the morning of the fifteenth.</p>

<p>All that night the two armies lay opposite to
each other, waiting for the daylight. The
American forces had more men than the British,
but many of them were raw recruits, and many
were deserters. Cornwallis’s men were in good
condition, and were almost all veteran fighters.</p>

<p>Before dawn the British began to take their
positions and prepare for an attack, and the
Americans made ready to meet them.</p>

<p>In the early dawning the first charge was
made. The Americans saw the forces charging
down upon them. The Virginia militia were
seized with a panic. The order came to fire.
Hardly knowing what they did, they fired one
shot and then threw down their arms and ran.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
The North Carolina regiment saw them running,
and without even one shot, they, too, threw
away their muskets and ran. Only the Delaware
men, the Marylanders and one North
Carolina regiment were left to bear the brunt of
the attack.</p>

<p>DeKalb now gave the order to his men to
charge with bayonets. Fiercely the Delaware
and Maryland regiments charged upon the
enemy,—so fiercely that they broke the British
line. But the British guns poured on them
volleys of grape and canister. It was more
than our men could bear. They were obliged to
retreat. Again came the order to charge, and
again they threw themselves against those solid
ranks of the British, and were driven back.
Three times they charged, and then, almost cut
to pieces, they were obliged to retreat. Of the
brave regiment of Delaware, a mere handful of
men was left. Baron DeKalb himself had
fallen, with eleven wounds.</p>

<p>So ended the terrible battle of Camden. After
it was over, many of the Americans hid themselves
in the swamps and woods for a time.
The few Delaware soldiers who were left joined
the Virginia regiment. They fought with them
through the rest of the war, and when peace was
declared Virginia offered to each of them one
hundred acres of ground if they would settle
there. However, they preferred to return to
their own state and people.</p>

<p>The prisoners who were taken were sent to
Charleston. Among them was Major Patten, a
gallant officer. He had taken with him into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
war his own body servant, a negro, and had entrusted
to him all his clothes. When the battle
was over the negro had disappeared and Major
Patten never saw him again. He entered
Charleston a prisoner, and in rags. There were
many loyal ladies there however, and they made
him a set of shirts and did for him what they
could. He was very handsome and gay, and as
he was allowed a great deal of liberty, he became
a great favorite. After the war was ended, he
returned to his home near Dover and showed
with pride some of these shirts which had been
made for him by the Charleston ladies.</p>

<p>He was more fortunate than many of the
other soldiers. Some of them returned in rags,
to find their farms and homesteads fallen almost
into ruin. Some had lost their health or were
suffering from wounds. But one thing our
Delaware men had won,—the glory of having
made part of that regiment fittingly called the
“picked regiment of the Continental Army.”<a name="FNanchor_6_26" id="FNanchor_6_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_26" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class='drop-cap'>AT ONE time Washington had his headquarters
in Wilmington. It was late in
the summer of 1777 and just before the
Battle of Brandywine.</p>

<p>A few weeks earlier the British fleet had sailed
out of New York harbor and had turned toward
the south, with all the British army on board.
No one knew where the fleet was going; no one
knew where the army would land and make
their next attack, and there was great anxiety.</p>

<p>General Washington and his army were at this
time camped in Bucks county, north of Philadelphia.
It was on August twenty-second that a
hot and dusty messenger galloped into camp
with news for the General that the British fleet
had been seen in Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>As soon as Washington heard this news, orders
were given to the army to break camp, and he
marched with them down to Delaware, to be
ready to meet the enemy, and to keep them
from attacking Philadelphia, for that was then
the capital of the colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilmington at that time was still a small
town. It had a few shops, a market house, and a
fire engine company called the “Friendship.”
A new ship-building company had just built and
launched their first boat, which was named the
“Wilmington.” But the most important of all
the manufactories were the Brandywine flour
mills, which stood on the Brandywine, some little
distance above where it flows into the Christiana.<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Washington had the “runners” (or upper stones)
taken from these mills and hauled up into
Chester County for fear they might be seized and
used by the British.</p>

<p>Wilmington is very hilly. It has been said of
it that it is “as full of lumps as a napkin thrown
over a blackberry bush.”</p>

<p>The steep part of West Street that slopes up
from Front to Fourth was called “Quaker Hill,”
for almost all the houses that were there were
owned by Quakers. The houses were built in a
prim, plain fashion, but within they were full of
comfort. Furniture, linen, food, were simple
but of the best quality for the Friends knew how
to live comfortably, in spite of their plain ways.</p>

<p>It was in one of these houses that Washington
made his headquarters. The house is still
standing, on the west side of the street, between
Third and Fourth Streets.</p>

<p>A little beyond Quaker Hill was an old apple
orchard, and still beyond that were the open
country and the wooded hills of the Brandywine.</p>

<p>It was near the Brandywine that the army
encamped. In the next few days soldiers might
often be seen kneeling on the edge of the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to wash their pieces of clothing. Their voices
echoed through the woods in loud jokes and
laughter. Sometimes a trooper in buff and blue
brought a dozen clattering horses down to the
water to drink.</p>

<p>Washington was busy sending and receiving
dispatches, riding out to explore the country,
and deciding where the best points were upon
which to place his army.</p>

<p>By September the second, our army had been
moved to the high lands near Newport, a few
miles from Wilmington. In the afternoon of
that day orders were given to cook provisions
and to be ready to march at any time. The
enemy were then near Newark, Delaware, but
Washington had not yet been able to learn how
many there were of them, nor where they meant
to attack. However he sent a light corps (of
about seven hundred and twenty men) down in
their direction. These men were to hide in the
woods and hollows, and to act as outposts in case
the British marched toward Newark.</p>

<p>It was the next day, September the third, that
the British began to advance toward White Clay
creek,—a creek which lay between them and the
Americans. For some miles above Newark the
road was open, with fields and meadows on
either hand, and the British marched along it
undisturbed. But when the road dipped into
the woods, the bullets began to sing about their
ears like bees. Several of the British were
wounded, for the American riflemen had hidden
in the thickets and hollows of the woods and were
shooting at them. The Americans were so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hidden that the British scarcely knew where
to turn their fire. Some of the British companies
left the road to look for them but got lost in a
swamp, and had difficulty in finding their way
back to firm ground.</p>

<p>For some miles this fire continued, but by the
time the British had reached the Christiana
creek, near Cooch’s Mill, the shots had almost
stopped.</p>

<p>The bridge across the stream lay still and
peaceful in the sunlight. There was no sound
but the ripple of the water against the rocks, and
a cow lowing in the distance.</p>

<p>The first company of the English had hardly
set foot on the bridge however, when a hot fire of
bullets poured out at them from the thickets beside
the stream. A company of American riflemen
had been lying there in ambush, and waiting
for them. A moment later the Americans
sprang out into the road with cheers, and charged
upon them.</p>

<p>A sharp skirmish followed, but the British
were too strong, and our men were driven back
leaving several killed and wounded. The British,
too, had their losses, though their loss was
not as heavy as that of the Americans.</p>

<p>This skirmish at Cooch’s Bridge was the first
warning Washington had that the British had
advanced their army.</p>

<p>Knowing the British were only a few miles
from him, Washington now expected an attack
at any time, and decided to move his army to a
high rise in the ground near Red Clay creek,
which was a better position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Caleb Byrnes, a miller, had a house on this
high ground. Very early on the morning of
September the seventh, he was awakened by the
tramp of marching feet, the sound of loud voices
shouting orders, and the clatter and rumble of
gun wagons.</p>

<p>He slipped from bed and crossed to the window
and looked out. There below, he saw long
lines and companies of soldiers in buff and blue.
Their bayonets glittered in the sunlight. Sweating
horses were pulling cannon up the slope in
front of the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Byrnes slipped from bed and came over
to look from the window, too. She was shivering
with excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s the whole American army,” said Byrnes.
He told his wife to waken the children and then
he dressed as quickly as he could and hurried
downstairs and out of the house.</p>

<p>An officer on horseback was there giving
orders. The cannon had now been placed all
along the high ground “for half a mile as thick
as they could stand.”<a name="FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_28" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the officer saw Mr. Byrnes, he rode
over to him and said, “You’d better get out of
here as soon as you can. When the battle begins
this house will be shot down and torn to
pieces by cannon.”</p>

<p>“And my mill?” asked Mr. Byrnes, pointing
to the mill, which stood about three-quarters of a
mile down the road.</p>

<p>“That will probably go, too,” said the officer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Byrnes had now come to the door and
stood listening. “Well, I’d rather stay right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
here,” she said. “If there’s a battle we’ll take
the children and get under the big arch that is
under the chimney in the cellar; there couldn’t
anything hurt us there, anyway.”</p>

<p>Mr. Byrnes agreed with his wife that they had
better stay; and in spite of the warnings of the
officers they refused to move. Mr. Byrnes’
brother, who lived near the mill, also refused to
leave his house. But the other neighbors
packed up their furniture and took their families
further up in the country, where they might be
safe from the cannon. As it happened, they
were no safer than the Byrnes after all, for on
September the ninth, Washington found that the
enemy were circling around him toward the
north in the direction of Philadelphia, and he
decided to move on and meet the British at
Chadd’s Ford, and force a battle there.</p>

<p>Marching orders were given, and a few hours
later the entire American army was gone from
Delaware.</p>

<p>So ended Washington’s first stay in our state.</p>

<p>But there was another time when Washington
was in Delaware. This second time he was no
longer commander-in-chief of a struggling army
but the President of the United States.</p>

<p>The war was over. Liberty was won, and the
English had left our shores.</p>

<p>It was December of 1783, and Washington was
to pass through Wilmington on his way from
Philadelphia to Mount Vernon, where he was
to eat his Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>People lined the road watching for his coach,
and at the top of the hill children climbed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
trees of the apple orchard so as to see the better.</p>

<p>At last, from far up the road, came a sound of
cheering; the coach was in sight. Nearer and
nearer it came.</p>

<p>In it sat President Washington with his calm,
noble face, and his powdered hair tied in a queue
behind. His hat was off, and he bowed this
way and that as the people waved and cheered
him.</p>

<p>The Burgess and Council of Wilmington had
prepared an address which was read to him and
which he answered. It was only for a few hours
that Washington was here this second time.
A long ride was still before him, and soon he was
in his coach again and rolling on his way.</p>

<p>For a while after the President’s coach had
started, the little boys raced along beside him,
then the horses broke into a trot that left the
boys behind. The turn of the road was reached,
the coach swung around it, and Washington’s
last visit to Delaware was over.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>CHIEF JUSTICE VINING’S
house faced “the Green”
at Dover.</p>

<p>The Green is a long, open square
with grass and trees. On either
side of it are handsome houses and pleasant
shady gardens with box trees and tall, old-fashioned
flowers.</p>

<p>It was on the Green, and in these gardens,
that the little Vinings and Rodneys and Ridgelys
and other little Dover children of long ago
played.</p>

<p>On this Green in 1776, the citizens and Revolutionary
soldiers gathered to build a great bonfire,
and burn the portrait of George the Third, no
longer their King.</p>

<p>Along the King’s Road, which runs through it,
Caesar Rodney galloped, on his long ride to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Philadelphia, and the brave regiments of Delaware
militia marched away to war.</p>

<p>Among the boys and girls who played on the
Green in those days were the children of the
Chief Justice, John and Mary Vining. They
were beautiful children, with curly brown hair,
rosy cheeks, and large clear grey eyes. Their
mother had died while they were very young, but
their aunt, Mrs. Ridgely, loved them dearly,
and her house was as much home to them as
their own. The year that Mary was fourteen,
Chief Justice Vining also died, and left a large
fortune to be divided between his two children.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgely had charge of this fortune, and
such good care did he take of it that when John
and Mary grew up they were among the richest
people in Delaware. But they were not only
rich;—they were handsome and witty as well.
John was such a favorite with everyone, that he
was called “The Pet of Delaware,” and his sister
was the belle of the whole colony. Louis
Philippe, Duc d’Orleans, visited her when he
was in America, and Lafayette admired her
greatly. The fame of her beauty was even
carried to foreign countries, so that when Jefferson
visited the French queen, Marie Antoinette,
one of the first questions she asked him was
whether Miss Vining of Delaware was really as
lovely as she was said to be.</p>

<p>Mary Vining spent as much of her time in
Philadelphia as at Dover. In the winter of 1777,
Lord Howe and his English troops were quartered
there, and many of the British officers lost
their hearts to the Delaware belle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, one of her young cousins was studying
his Latin in the drawing room when the door
opened and Mary Vining swept in. She went
over to the mirror and stood for some time looking
at herself with admiration. She was in full
dress, and her beautiful arms and neck were
bare. After a while she turned from the mirror,
and then she saw her young cousin sitting there
and watching her. She smiled and held out her
hand to him. “Come here, you little rogue,”
she said “and you may kiss my hand.”</p>

<p>The little boy shook his head shyly and
drew back.</p>

<p>Miss Vining laughed. “You might well be
glad to,” she said, “‘Princes have lipped it’.”<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Afterward, when the little boy had grown to
be a man he often told this story, and always
added, “All the while I thought her the most
beautiful creature I’d ever seen.”</p>

<p>Some of Mary’s friends wondered that she did
not marry. “To tell the truth,” she answered
them frankly, “I have grown so used to the admiration
of many men that I do not think I
could be content with that of one.”</p>

<p>Indeed, she had become rather spoiled by so
much admiration. She loved her own way and
was determined to have it. She felt she was so
beautiful and rich that she could do whatever
she chose. It was one of her fancies never to
walk in the street; she always rode in her coach
or went on horseback, however short the distance,
and she always covered her face with a
veil so that people could not stare at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time General Washington was quartered
in Wilmington, and while he was there many
of his officers found time to ride down to Dover
to see Miss Vining. There was one of Washington’s
officers whom she had never met, but she
had heard a great deal about him;—that was
General Anthony Wayne. He was at this time
a married man, though his wife died before the
close of the war. He seemed to Miss Vining to
be the most brilliant officer in the whole army,
and she was never tired of hearing of his wild exploits.
“Mad Anthony Wayne,” they called
him. His fellow officers said he was vain<a name="FNanchor_2_30" id="FNanchor_2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_30" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and a boaster; but he was so brave, and so ready
to carry out his boasts that no one dared to
laugh at him.</p>

<p>General Washington trusted him so much that
he asked his opinion about almost every important
move in the war, and he was the one whom
Washington chose to lead the attack on Stony
Point. The storming of Stony Point was the
most daring act of the whole war.</p>

<p>Stony Point is a steep bluff on the Hudson.
On three sides of it are water and on the fourth a
deep swamp. The English held it with a garrison
of over five hundred soldiers, and their cannon
were set so as to guard every road to it.</p>

<p>It was the night of July the fifteenth, at half
past eleven that Wayne and his brave company
of soldiers set out. They moved in silence, with
not a word spoken, except now and then a whispered
command. Orders had been given that if
any soldier left the ranks, no matter for what
reason, he should be instantly killed.<a name="FNanchor_3_31" id="FNanchor_3_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_31" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in order that no deserter might have a chance to
carry news of the surprise to the British.</p>

<p>To reach the rise of Stony Point, Wayne and
his company were obliged to wade through water
two feet deep. Then came the climb up the hill,
over rocks and sharp stones. At last they were
near enough to the fort to hear the call of the
sentries. When the signal was given, the Americans
attacked the fort from all sides at once.</p>

<p>The garrison was taken by surprise, and
fired wildly; they had no time to aim their canon.
A musket ball struck General Wayne, and made
a long wound in his scalp. He was stunned and
fell to the ground, but a moment later he rose on
one knee and waved his sword, “Forward, my
brave fellows! <i>Forward</i>,” he shouted.</p>

<p>His wound was not serious, but his soldiers,
when they saw him fall, were filled with fury.
They charged into the fort with their bayonets,
climbing over walls and killing those who tried
to stop them. Not a shot was fired by the
Americans except at the very first, and then only
to draw the attention of the British in the
wrong direction.</p>

<p>This capture of Stony Point made General
Wayne famous. He was said to be the most
brilliant officer in the army. Praises were
showered on him,<a name="FNanchor_4_32" id="FNanchor_4_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_32" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and later on he was made
General-in-Chief of the army.</p>

<p>Years slipped by and the war came to an end.
The American colonies were free, and the English
left our shores and sailed back to their own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>General Wayne was by this time a widower,
and Mary Vining was no longer young. But
though she was not young she was as beautiful,
and witty and charming as ever.</p>

<p>She was almost forty when news came to her
cousins in Dover that she was engaged to be
married to General Wayne. At first they could
not believe it. General Wayne was a brave
soldier, he was handsome, generous and honest,
but he had been brought up on a farm, and he
had none of the elegance of the foreign officers,
who had been her friends.</p>

<p>But Mary Vining loved him, and was determined
to marry him. The time for the wedding
was set. It was to be in January, and Miss
Vining began to make ready for it. Her house
was already handsome, but she refurnished it,
from top to bottom. General Wayne gave her a
set of India china, and she bought a new service
of silver.</p>

<p>In December, Wayne was sent west by the
government, to make a treaty with the Maumee
Indians. He had fought with them and defeated
them the year before, and they would be more
ready to treat with him than with any one else.
He was to return to Delaware by the first of
January.</p>

<p>But the brave soldier never returned. At
the first of the year, on New Year’s Day, word
was brought to Miss Vining that he had died at
Presque Isle, on Lake Erie.</p>

<p>Miss Vining immediately put on mourning for
General Wayne, and this mourning she never laid
aside again as long as she lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after Wayne’s death, her brother, “The
Pet of Delaware,” died too. It was found that
he had spent, not only all his own fortune, but
his sister’s as well. She was now a poor woman.
Nothing was left her but a little house in Wilmington
called “The Willows,” which stood
where the du Pont building now stands, and
which had once belonged to her mother. She
was obliged to sell her coach and horses, and she
sent away her servants.</p>

<p>Her brother had left four children, and she
made these her care for the rest of her life. She
brought them up and educated them.</p>

<p>The china that had been General Wayne’s
last gift to her, was never used, but was kept by
her as her most precious treasure.</p>

<p>She saw almost no one at “The Willows,” but
the few who were allowed to visit her, found her
always in black, and with her beautiful hair hidden
under a widow’s cap. But she was still,
even in old age, as gracious, as witty and charming
as when she had been the wealthy and
courted <i>Belle of Delaware</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_33" id="FNanchor_5_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

been a vain man; but he was said to be vain both for himself and
his regiment. At the beginning of the war he told his regiment
that there would be a barber in each company to shave the
soldiers and dress their hair; (their hair was to be plaited and
powdered) and that any man who came on parade with a long
beard, carelessly dressed, or dirty, was to be punished. He told
General Washington he would rather lead his men into action
well dressed and with only one round of cartridges, than with
all the ammunition that they needed and yet ragged and dirty.</p></div>

<p class='dropcapstory'>COMMODORE THOMAS MACDONOUGH
was sometimes called
“the Boy Commodore,” for he
was the youngest Commodore
in the American navy.</p>

<p>He was born December, thirty-first, 1783, on
a farm in New Castle county where his father and
grandfather had lived before him.</p>

<p>When he was seventeen he joined the navy as a
Midshipman, and made his first cruise on the
ship “Ganges.”</p>

<p>He was a tall, thin, shy youth. He was never
strong, but he was so brave that he was ready for
any dangers or hardships. Cooper called him
“the modest but lion-hearted MacDonough.”</p>

<p>At the time MacDonough joined the navy, the
United States was at war with France, and his
first cruise was against the French in the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Indies. The “Ganges” captured three of the
enemy’s vessels, and sent them home as prizes.
Then the yellow fever broke out on board the
“Ganges.” MacDonough was one of the men who
had it. He and the other sick men were carried
on shore to a miserable dirty Spanish hospital at
Havana. Here, for many weeks, he lay ill.</p>

<p>When he was able to get up and go about again
he found that the “Ganges” had sailed away, and
that he was left, poor, alone, and almost without
clothing, in a strange land. All the Americans
who had been brought to the hospital had died
except himself and two others. These two were
in as much distress as himself. The American
agent at Havana gave them some shirts and
other pieces of clothing, and they got back to the
United States on a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>MacDonough landed at Norfolk, Virginia, and
worked his way back to Delaware. He had been
away from home a year, and his family had
never expected to see him again; they had been
told he had the yellow fever at Havana, and was
either dying or already dead. They could hardly
believe it was he when he walked in among
them, thin, pale and weak-looking, but still
alive. The whole house was filled with rejoicings.
He was still dressed as he had been when
he left Havana, in worn out clothes, a straw hat
and canvas shoes.</p>

<p>As soon as he was able, he went back to the
“Ganges,” and was with her until he was ordered
to the Mediterranean on the frigate “Philadelphia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>We were then at war with Tripoli. Soon after
the “Philadelphia” reached the Mediterranean,
they captured a Moorish vessel, and MacDonough
was sent on board of her to take her to
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>It was a very lucky thing for MacDonough that
he was ordered on to this other vessel, for very
soon after he left the “Philadelphia” she ran
aground, and was captured by the enemy. All
the men and officers on board of her were
taken prisoner.</p>

<p>After the “Philadelphia” was taken by the
enemy, the Americans were very anxious to
destroy it, for now the enemy had the ship and
might use it as a war vessel. But it seemed as
though it would be almost impossible to destroy
the “Philadelphia.” It lay in the harbor of
Tripoli, close under the fortress, and above it
were the black mouths of the cannon. If the
Tripoli gunners had seen any American ship
come into the harbor, they would have blown it
to pieces rather than let it come near their prize.</p>

<p>The only way to get to the vessel would be by
using some trick.</p>

<p>Stephen Decatur, then a young commander,
was very anxious to try it. It would mean the
risk of his life, and of the lives of all who went
with him; but every sailor on his vessel was as
eager to try as he himself. From among them
all he chose sixty-two to go with him, and
MacDonough was one of those chosen.</p>

<p>They set sail for the bay of Tripoli, in a ketch,
(a sort of small merchant vessel) which they
named “Intrepid.” Almost all the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
hid down in the lower part of the ketch. Only a
few stayed on deck. Those on deck darkened
their faces, and dressed themselves as Maltese
sailors, with red fezzes and round jackets. The
inside of the ketch was filled with powder and
everything else necessary for blowing up the
“Philadelphia,” if they could only get to her.</p>

<p>Boldly the little ketch with these brave men
on board sailed into the enemy’s harbor.</p>

<p>The Tripolitans, looking from their forts, saw
nothing but what seemed to be a Maltese merchant
ship, sailing into the harbor to shelter
there for the night,—for the daylight was already
fading from the sky and the moon was
rising.</p>

<p>The “Intrepid” sailed slowly across the harbor
to where the “Philadelphia” lay under the fortress.
Aboard of her were the Tripoli officers on
the watch.</p>

<p>When the ketch was near enough to the
“Philadelphia,” an American officer hailed her,
speaking in the Maltese language. He said they
had lost their anchors at sea, and asked whether
they might fasten their boat to the “Philadelphia”
for the night.</p>

<p>The Tripoli officer hesitated a moment.
“That is a very unusual thing to ask,” he said.
However, he agreed that they might, and a
hawser rope was flung over to the ketch for them
to fasten by.</p>

<p>Just then the “Intrepid” swung out from
under the shadow of the “Philadelphia,” and the
moon shone down on her deck. There on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
deck, in the full light, lay the anchors that the
officer said had been lost at sea.</p>

<p>Immediately the Tripoli men knew that a
trick had been played upon them. “Americanos!
Americanos!” they shouted. But they
had found it out too late. The ketch was already
fastened to the side of the larger vessel.
The Americans swarmed over the sides of the
“Philadelphia,” and the Tripolitans found themselves
fighting for their lives. MacDonough was
the third man to spring aboard of the ship. In a
short time all the Tripolitans were killed or driven
overboard, the powder was hastily carried
from the ketch to the “Philadelphia,” and she
was set on fire. Then the Americans returned
to their own boat. They cut loose and rowed
at full speed away from the “Philadelphia” and
across the harbor.</p>

<p>The men in the fortress near by, had seen that
strange things were happening on board the
“Philadelphia,” but in the uncertain moonlight
they could not tell just what the matter was. It
was not until they saw the ketch well across the
harbor, and flames and smoke pouring from the
“Philadelphia” that they realized what had
happened. Then their cannon roared, but the
balls fell short. The men on the “Intrepid” rose
to their feet, waved their caps, and in the red
light of the burning ship, gave three rousing
American cheers. Then they again fell to their
oars, and rowed out of the harbor to where the
“Siren,” an American war vessel, was waiting
for them outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>This burning of the “Philadelphia” was said
by Admiral Nelson, to be “the most bold and
daring act of the age.”</p>

<p>MacDonough had shown such bravery in this
action that he was made a lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was while MacDonough was still on this
Mediterranean cruise that he had an adventure
with three cut-throats.</p>

<p>The commander had given him leave to go on
shore one day, and toward evening, as he was
coming back to his boat, three cut-throats set
upon him in a lonely place. Instead of trying to
escape, MacDonough turned upon them and
fought so fiercely that he soon wounded two of
them, and the third took to his heels and ran.
MacDonough ran after him. He chased the
man for some distance, and then they came to a
low building; into this building the man dashed,
and up the stairs, with MacDonough still after
him. When he reached the roof he looked behind
him. There still was the terrible Americano.
Then the man ran to the edge of the
roof and jumped off, for he felt he would rather
run the risk of breaking his neck than fight with
MacDonough.</p>

<p>When MacDonough came down stairs again,
he looked all around for the man, but he could
not see him, so he quietly returned to his boat
and rowed back to the ship.</p>

<p>In 1806, MacDonough was first lieutenant on
the “Siren,” with Captain Smith in command.</p>

<p>They were lying just off Gibraltar at one time,
and at some distance from them were anchored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
two other vessels. One was an American merchant
ship, and the other a British frigate.</p>

<p>One day Captain Smith had gone on shore and
MacDonough was in charge of the “Siren.” In
the afternoon he saw a boat put off from the frigate
and row over to the merchant ship. It lay
there for a while, and then when it started to return
to the frigate he saw that there was one
more man in her than there had been before.</p>

<p>MacDonough knew that the captains of
English warships sometimes kidnapped American
sailors, and made them serve on board the
British vessels, and he suspected that this
extra man was an American who was being stolen
from the crew of the merchant ship.</p>

<p>He immediately sent over to the ship to ask
whether this were so.</p>

<p>The captain told him “Yes;”—that the British
had come on board, and taken one of his
sailors. The captain had been afraid to resist
them, for the frigate had guns and he had none.</p>

<p>As soon as MacDonough heard this, he had a
cutter lowered, and set out in chase of the
British boat. The Englishmen were rowing in a
very leisurely manner, for they never dreamed
that any one would dare to interfere with their
prize.</p>

<p>MacDonough caught up to them just as they
reached the frigate. The prisoner was sitting in
the stem of the boat. MacDonough’s men
drove the cutter so close that the two boats
grated together. One of the Englishmen shouted
to them to keep off, but instead MacDonough
reached over, and catching hold of the prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dragged him, bodily, into his own boat. Then
his rowers gave way, and before the Englishmen
could recover from their surprise, he was on his
way back to the “Siren,” the rescued man with
him.</p>

<p>The British captain had seen the whole affair
from the deck of the frigate, and he was in a fury.
He got into a boat and had himself rowed over to
the “Siren.” When he came on board, he saw
MacDonough walking quietly up and down the
deck, with his hands clasped behind him.</p>

<p>The captain marched up to him insolently.
“Where is that man you took? I must have him
back,” he cried.</p>

<p>“I will not give him up,” answered MacDonough
quietly.</p>

<p>“You dare to tell me that? Why you are not
even the captain of this vessel, and you dare to
say you will not let me have the man?”</p>

<p>“I will answer to it to my captain,” said MacDonough,
“and I will not give him up.”</p>

<p>The captain raged and threatened to turn
the frigate’s guns against the “Siren” and blow
it out of the water.</p>

<p>“You can do it, no doubt, if you choose,”
answered MacDonough, “but as long as this boat
is afloat I will never give that man up.”</p>

<p>The captain finding he could gain nothing,
got into his boat again and had himself rowed
over toward the merchant vessel.</p>

<p>MacDonough feared he might try to kidnap
another man, so he entered the cutter and followed
close after the British boat. The Englishmen
rowed about for some time and then finding they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
could not shake him off they returned to the frigate.
Then, and not till then, MacDonough
went back to the “Siren.”</p>

<p>The English officers one and all admired MacDonough’s
conduct in this affair, and always
afterward spoke of him with great admiration.</p>

<p>But it was in the battle of Lake Champlain
that MacDonough won his greatest fame.</p>

<p>Our troubles with England had finally ended
in a war with her. MacDonough was put in
command of the naval forces on Lake Champlain.
He was then a little over thirty years old.</p>

<p>The battle was fought on a clear, bright
September morning, in 1814.</p>

<p>Before the battle began the Commodore (as
MacDonough was then called) knelt on the deck
of the “Saratoga,” and with his officers and crew
about him, he prayed for success in the conflict.</p>

<p>When a little later they were clearing the
decks of the “Saratoga” for action, they let out
some chickens that were in coops, and threw
the coops overboard. One of the cocks flew up
on the rigging and flapped his wings and crowed
loud and long. It was as if he recognized in the
Commodore one of the “Blue Hen’s Chickens,”
and was greeting him.</p>

<p>The sailors took his crowing as a sign of victory,
and cheered in answer to him.</p>

<p>The American ships were scarcely set in battle
order, before the British squadron came sailing
proudly around a wooded point of land. The red
flags at their mast-heads fluttered gaily in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>MacDonough himself fired the first shot from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the “Saratoga.” The gun was aimed at the
British flagship “Confidence,” and the shot
killed and wounded several of her men, and
carried away her wheel. Again and again,
through the battle, MacDonough, with his own
hands, helped to work the guns. Three times he
was struck by splinters and thrown across the
decks. Once a heavy spar fell over him and
knocked him senseless. Once a shot blew off
the head of a gunner, and threw it against him
with such force that he was again knocked
across the deck and into the scuppers. But he
was not seriously hurt, though every other officer
on the “Saratoga” was either killed or wounded.</p>

<p>By mid-day the battle was over and the
Americans had won. So fierce had been the broadsides
that not a single mast was left standing on
the vessel of either of the opposing squadrons.</p>

<p>After the battle was ended the American officers
all gathered on the deck of the “Saratoga”
and the British officers came to give up their
swords to MacDonough.</p>

<p>Instead of taking them, however, MacDonough
said, “Gentlemen, your gallant conduct
makes you the more worthy to wear your
swords;” and he bade them put them back in
their scabbards and keep them.</p>

<p>Every care was now given to the wounded on
both sides, and MacDonough himself visited
every ship in his squadron, and thanked the
officers and men for their bravery.</p>

<p>News of the American victory was received
with joy all over the country. Congress offered
a vote of thanks to MacDonough, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
states and towns gave him presents. But
through it all he was still the modest MacDonough.
Often tears came into his eyes when he
was speaking of all the country had done for him.</p>

<p>This was almost his last battle. Soon after
it, peace was declared, and he left Lake Champlain
and went back to the ocean.</p>

<p>In 1825 he was Commander of the “Constitution,”
in the Mediterranean. But his health
failed and he determined to go home. He never
reached his country, however. On November
tenth, he died, leaving behind him an undying
name—a brave officer, a great seaman, and a
Christian gentleman. In memory of MacDonough,
the place near which he was born has
been named after him, and in the great warship
“Delaware,” the largest in the present American
navy, his portrait (presented by the Colonial
Dames of the State) is hung with those of Admiral
Jones and Admiral du Pont, to commemorate
the naval heroes of Delaware.</p>

<h2>How Once Upon A Time<br />
Delaware Welcomed<br />
Lafayette.</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_141.jpg" width="600" height="362" alt="Old Bridge over the Brandywine at Wilmington" />
</div>


<p class='drop-cap'>WHEN Lafayette was in America, helping
us fight for liberty, he made many
friends among the Delaware people.
Caesar Rodney was then President of
Delaware, and Lafayette was often entertained
at his house. It was there that he met the beautiful
Miss Vining. He and she became great
friends, and for a great many years they used to
write to each other.</p>

<p>When Washington had his headquarters in
Wilmington, Lafayette came with him. He
staid at the house of a Quaker, Mr. Joseph Tatnall,
in Brandywine Village, just across the
stream from Wilmington. General Wayne and
other of Washington’s officers, were stationed at
Mr. Tatnall’s house, too.</p>

<p>Brandywine Village was then a separate place,
and not a part of Wilmington as it is now.
There was no bridge across the Brandywine, and
people who wished to go from one place to the
other, were ferried across the stream.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Lafayette
often crossed the Brandywine in this
way. He would ride his horse on to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
clumsy boat and sit quietly while it was ferried
over; then he would ride clattering off on the
Wilmington side, and up the hilly streets to join
Washington at his headquarters.</p>

<p>Often General Washington himself would cross
in the ferry to Brandywine Village, and come to
the Tatnall house to discuss plans of battle with
Lafayette, and the other officers. These meetings
were held in the back parlor; there was a
large round table in the middle of the room, and
on this they spread out their maps and plans.
Washington kept other important papers at the
Tatnall house, too. It was a safer place than
his headquarters in Wilmington.</p>

<p>Lafayette was at this time a very gay and
dashing young officer, and the Tatnall children,
who were shy little Quakers, were rather afraid
of him. After he had been out riding he used to
come marching into the house, snapping his
riding whip, and glancing about him with keen,
bright eyes; his spurs jingled as he walked. The
children generally ran and hid when they heard
him coming,—that is all but the youngest, a
pretty little girl of two or three. She never felt
the least fear of the Frenchman. She would run
to meet him, holding up her little bare dimpled
arms for him to take her. Then Lafayette
would swing her up on his shoulder, and march
with her through the house. He called her “his
little sweetheart.”</p>

<p>But one morning Lafayette and the other
officers said good-bye, and went down to the
ferry for the last time. His “little sweetheart”
never saw him again. He had gone with
Washington and his army to meet the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
further north, and to fight in the battle of
Brandywine.</p>

<p>After the Revolution was over, and the colonies
were free, Lafayette went back to France,
and it was almost forty years before he visited
America again. In that time, there were many
changes. Washington died and was buried at
his beloved home, Mount Vernon. Lafayette
himself had changed from a gay, dashing officer
to a stately, grey-haired man of sixty-seven.</p>

<p>He landed at New York on August, sixteenth,
1824, and was welcomed with great honor as
“the nation’s guest.” Flowers were strewn before
him. In many places the horses were
taken from his carriage, and it was drawn
through the streets by the people themselves.</p>

<p>There were at that time, twenty-four states in
the Union, and Lafayette wished to visit each
one of them. He planned to come to Wilmington
on October, sixth, so as to attend the wedding
of Mr. Charles I. du Pont and Miss VanDyke,
the daughter of U. S. Senator, Nicholas
VanDyke, at New Castle in the evening of that
day. Lafayette had known Mr. du Pont’s
father in France, for they were of a French
family.</p>

<p>Great preparations were made by all the
people of Wilmington and its vicinity, (indeed
from all parts of the State) to welcome Lafayette.</p>

<p>The day of his arrival dawned clear and
bright. As early as seven o’clock in the morning
all the town was astir. Fifes were sounded,
drums were beaten. The Wilmington City Troop
was to march up the Philadelphia pike and meet
the General at the state line, between Pennsylvania
and Delaware. This City Troop had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
named the “Lafayette Guard,” in honor of their
visitor. With the troop were to ride about
two hundred of the young men of Wilmington.
These young men were all dressed alike, in white
trousers, blue or black coats, and high black
stocks. They all wore Revolutionary cockades,
and Lafayette badges. A number of the older
men of Wilmington rode out with them, too, in
carriages.</p>

<p>At the boundary line in Brandywine Hundred,
near the Practical Farmer, a magnificent floral
arch had been erected with the American eagle
suspended in the centre, a United States flag,
with a portrait of Washington underneath of it
and the words:—</p>

<p class='center'>
“DELAWARE WELCOMES LAFAYETTE.”<br />
</p>

<p>Advancing into the city of Wilmington, his
reception was overwhelming. Flowers were
strewn in his pathway; arches of evergreens,
decorated with flags, had been built across
Market Street at different points. From one of
the arches hung a model of the ship “Brandywine,”
and above it were the words, “<i>In honor of
Lafayette, the friend of Civil Liberty</i>.”</p>

<p>The ladies of the town had decorated Brandywine
bridge so that it was almost hidden by
wreaths and flowers. It was over this bridge
that Lafayette would enter the town.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock when the procession set
out from Wilmington and marched up the Philadelphia
pike to meet the distinguished guest.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock word was brought that
General Lafayette was then in sight. The procession
drew up in order, and as soon as Lafayette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
appeared the men burst into a loud shout
of “Long live Lafayette!”</p>

<p>Lafayette rose and bowed in answer. He
was riding in a barouche, and with him was his
son, George Washington Lafayette. He was
escorted by the First City Troop of Philadelphia,
and a number of well known men.</p>

<p>As soon as Lafayette reached the State line
where the Wilmington procession was waiting,
he stepped from the barouche down into the
road.</p>

<p>The Honorable Louis McLane came forward
to meet him, and made a speech of welcome.
Lafayette answered him, and in his answer he
spoke of the war for liberty, in which he had
fought, and of the great bravery of the Delaware
regiment in that war.</p>

<p>Mr. McLane then asked to introduce to the
General, three men who had fought in the
Delaware regiment,—three of the Blue Hen’s
Chickens. They were, Major Peter Jaquet,
Captain Caleb P. Bennett and Colonel Allen
McLane. Colonel McLane, an old man of
eighty-three years, was dressed in the Colonial
uniform he had worn in the war.</p>

<p>Other prominent citizens of Delaware were
introduced, and then Lafayette stepped into the
carriage that had been brought for him, and to
the music of the band, the procession moved
on toward Wilmington.</p>

<p>As they reached the top of Shellpot hill, just
outside of the city, the dull boom of a cannon
sounded across the sunny fields. Again it boomed,
and still again, till thirteen shots had been
fired, one shot for each of the thirteen original
colonies. It was a salute to Lafayette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The General was very anxious to stop in
Brandywine Village, at the Tatnall house. His
old friend, Joseph Tatnall, had died many years
before, but his son was still living in a stone
house close by.</p>

<p>He was standing in the doorway when Lafayette’s
carriage stopped before the house. He
hurried down to the street to welcome the General.
He had his little son in his arms, and at a
whispered word from his father, the little fellow
held out a beautiful basket of Washington pears.</p>

<p>Lafayette took it with a smile, and thanked
the child. “You were not so many years older
than this little fellow, when I was here before,”
said the General to the father.</p>

<p>“And my little sweetheart?” added the General.
“What has become of her? Shall I
see her?”</p>

<p>But the little sweetheart was dead. Years
before, she had grown up and married, and then
had died, leaving a daughter. Lafayette wished
to see this daughter, but she was away at boarding
school. Mr. Tatnall had asked the mistress
of the school to allow his niece to come to him
for that day, but the mistress had refused; she
was so strict that she would not allow the young
girl to be absent for a day, even to meet General
Lafayette.</p>

<p>Just beyond the bridge, a great crowd of
people had gathered. They cheered wildly as
Lafayette’s carriage rolled across the bridge. At
the same time, all the bells in the city began to
ring, and so with shouts and music, and the pealing
of bells, General Lafayette was welcomed
back to Delaware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The procession paraded through the streets
and under the arches, and at last drew up before
the City Hall, where a great feast had been made
ready. About two hundred people were at the
banquet.</p>

<p>Just as the feast was ended, an old woman
pushed her way into the hall, and came to where
Mr. McLane was standing. Mr. McLane knew
who she was very well. Her name was Belle
McClosky, and she earned her living by selling
cakes and pies about the town. Wherever she
went, she always carried an old musket ball in
her pocket. Often she took out this ball and
showed it to her customers, and boasted that she
had taken it out of General Lafayette’s wound
with a pair of scissors when he was wounded at
the Battle of Brandywine.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as she reached Mr. McLane’s
side, she said, “Mr. McLane, I want you to
introduce me to General Lafayette.”</p>

<p>Mr. McLane hesitated a moment; then he said
“Very well, Belle, I will do it. I know you are a
true patriot, and I believe you saved many a
poor soldier’s life at the time of the war.”</p>

<p>He then led Belle over to General Lafayette.
The General spoke to her pleasantly, but he
had not the least idea who she was.</p>

<p>“General,” said Belle, “do you remember
being wounded at the Battle of Brandywine, and
the young woman who took out the ball with
a pair of scissors?”</p>

<p>“I remember very well,” answered Lafayette.
“She saved me several hours of suffering. I
would like to see her again, that I might thank
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Belle took the ball from her pocket, and held
it out to him in her hand. “This is the ball,”
said she, “and I am the woman who took it out,
though I am so old now it is no wonder that you
do not know me.”</p>

<p>Lafayette was amazed. He thanked her
warmly, and then took the ball and looked at it.
“So you have kept it all these years,” he said.
“That is very curious.”</p>

<p>Then he gave the ball back to her, and Belle
went out from the hall that day a very proud and
happy woman.</p>

<p>Lafayette paid only one visit in Wilmington,
and that was to Mrs. Connel. She was the wife of
Mr. John Connel who had been very kind to some
French soldiers at the time of the war between
France and Russia.<a name="FNanchor_2_35" id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_35" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, the General set out for
New Castle, to attend the wedding there.</p>

<p>New Castle had prepared to welcome him
with a military salute. There were two six
pound cannons in the old arsenal at New Castle,
that were named the “Wasp” and the “Hornet.”</p>

<p>They had been moved to the northeast end of
the town, near the site of old Fort Casimir,
ready for use. As the procession passed Rogers’
Woods, and came in sight of New Castle, the
gunners began. The cannons boomed and boomed
incessantly until Lafayette had entered the
house of George Read, 2nd, on Water St., where
he was received, and where guards were placed
at the front door to keep back the crowd.</p>

<p>In the evening Lafayette attended the wedding.
At this wedding, he was, of course, the
guest of honor. The chair where he was to sit
was raised so as to be higher than any others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the room, and was wreathed about with flowers.</p>

<p>A great crowd gathered before the house to
see General Lafayette.</p>

<p>Senator VanDyke, the father of the bride, gave
orders that the door and windows should be left
open, so that the people outside could see the
General and also the wedding party.</p>

<p>Afterward, he went to take supper and spend
the night, with George Read, 2nd, the son of the
signer of the Declaration of Independence.
The next morning, he was driven over to Frenchtown,
Maryland, on the Elk river, where he was
met and welcomed by the Marylanders.</p>

<p>So Lafayette passed through Delaware, on his
tour through the States, and so the Delaware
people welcomed him. It was a beautiful greeting,
and Delaware may well be proud of the day
when Lafayette was here.</p>

<h2>How Once Upon A Time<br />
Mason And Dixon<br />
Ran A Boundary</h2>

<img src="images/i_b_155.jpg" width="600" height="402" alt="A Rose—at Michaelmas" />
</div>


<p class='drop-cap'>OF ALL the States belonging to the United
States of America, there are no two that
are of the same size or shape. Some are
big and some are little. One is almost square.
One is shaped like a boot.</p>

<p>Delaware, has two boundaries, one on the west
and one on the south, that are perfectly straight.
On the east the boundary follows the line of the
Delaware River and bay. The northern line of
the State is an arc, or part of a circle. If you put
a pin through the little dot on the map that is
marked “New Castle,” and tie a thread to it
and measure, you will find how perfect this arc
of the circle is, and you will also find that New
Castle is the centre of the circle.</p>

<p>Why should Delaware have this queer curved
northern boundary? It is because, many years
ago, as this book has told once before, in 1681,
King Charles the Second of England gave what
is now Pennsylvania to William Penn. In that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
grant, Penn was given “that extensive forest
lying twelve miles northward of New Castle, on
the northern side of the Delaware,” the southern
boundary of which was a circle drawn twelve
miles distant from New Castle northward and
westward.</p>

<p>Penn, at first, was contented with this grant
from King Charles. But when he looked over
his land grant carefully, he saw that it would
be much better for Pennsylvania to have at
least a strip of land that would run along one side
of the Delaware River and down to the Delaware
Bay. This land had been already given by the
King, to his brother, the Duke of York.</p>

<p>If Penn only had that strip of land, his ships
could sail up the river more safely. He could also
carry on a better trade with the Indians along
its banks. So he asked the Duke of York to let
him have this river land. We have already read
how the Duke of York answered him,—how the
Provinces on the Delaware were given to Penn on
lease, for a certain share of rents and profits, and
a rose to be presented to the Duke every Michaelmas,
on demand. This lease was to run ten
thousand years, which was the same as if it were
a gift out and out.</p>

<p>So what is now our State of Delaware came
into the possession of William Penn, and in the
deeds its boundaries were laid out; the northern
one was still to be the arc of the circle drawn
around New Castle. Its western boundary was
to be a straight line drawn on down from the rim
of this “twelve mile circle,” till it should meet
another line, a straight one, which was to be
drawn from Cape Henlopen across to the Chesapeake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and was to be the southern boundary of
the State. If you will look at the map in the
front of the book, you can see how the arc of the
twelve-mile circle and the two straight lines to
the south and the east give Delaware its present
shape. The eastern part of the land within the
twelve mile circle extended all the way to low
water mark on the New Jersey shore, and also
to the center of the bay south of the circle. The
grant gave Penn the Pea-Patch Island too, where
Fort Delaware was afterward built.</p>

<p>The Duke of York gave the land to William
Penn. But years and years before that, long
before the Duke of York himself owned the
Provinces on the Delaware, there was another
Englishman who claimed them as his own.</p>

<p>This was Lord Baltimore. In 1632, the King
had given him a grant not only of Maryland, but
of what is now Delaware, as well. The grant
was given on the word of Lord Baltimore, that no
Christian people had ever settled on the peninsula.
But, as we know, about one year before
that DeVries had landed at Zwannendael, had
bought the land there and had started his little
settlement. Probably Lord Baltimore knew
nothing of this. Whether he knew or not, the
King was very angry when he found what a
mistake had been made, and that the Dutch had
made a settlement in Delaware years before.
There was even a great deal of doubt as to
whether Lord Baltimore’s grant would hold good.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of this doubt that Lord
Baltimore did not make any claim to these
Delaware lands until 1659. At that time, his
brother, Lord Calvert, was the Governor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Maryland. The Dutch were living along the
Delaware, and had built forts there.</p>

<p>In that year (1659) five or six Dutch soldiers
deserted from the Dutch fort at New Amstel<a name="FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and fled down into Maryland.</p>

<p>The Dutch Director-General sent a message to
Lord Calvert, asking him to send the deserters
back to him.</p>

<p>Lord Calvert answered the Dutchman very
politely. He was very willing to send the soldiers
back, he said, but at the same time he wished
to warn the Director that New Amstel and
Altona,<a name="FNanchor_2_37" id="FNanchor_2_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_37" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and all the land along the Delaware up
to the fortieth degree, belonged to Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>When this message was brought to the Dutch
Director and his council, they were surprised indeed.
This was the first they had heard of the
English having any claim to the land at all.
They could hardly believe it, and yet they were
so afraid of getting into trouble with the English
that some of the councillors wanted to leave New
Amstel at once, and move up to the Hudson,
where they would be safe.</p>

<p>It was not long before they heard again from
Maryland. In August, Colonel Utie came over
from St. Mary’s,<a name="FNanchor_3_38" id="FNanchor_3_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_38" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> bringing letters and messages
from Lord Calvert. The message that he
brought was that the Dutch must move away at
once. They must give over all the land to the
English. However, they might stay on one condition.
That was that they would obey English
rules, and would agree that Lord Baltimore was
the owner of the land and their ruler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the Director and his council could agree
to this condition, they said they would have to
consult with Governor Stuyvesant.</p>

<p>Colonel Utie was quite willing for them to
consult their governor, and he gave them three
weeks to send their messengers to New Amsterdam
and learn from Governor Stuyvesant what
they were to do.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, to a day, the Director and
his council met together, and three weeks later,
to a day, Colonel Utie came to their meeting to
hear what they had to say. They had heard
from Governor Stuyvesant, and his messages
were very decided. The Dutch were not to give
up the land, and they were not to own Lord
Baltimore as their ruler. The land belonged to
the Dutch. They had bought it from the Indians;
they had been its first settlers and they
had “sealed it with their blood” at Zwannendael.</p>

<p>But Stuyvesant did more than send this answer
to the English. He quietly sent messengers
down along the Delaware, and bought from
the Indians all the land that did not already belong
to the Dutch, and he built a fort at Hoornkill,
and made ready to protect his land.</p>

<p>Lord Calvert did not force him to fight for his
rights, however. The English governor seemed
quite as unwilling as the Dutch had been to carry
the dispute any further.</p>

<p>But the Dutch were not to keep the land very
much longer, in spite of the friendliness of Lord
Calvert. It was soon to be taken from them,
and by the English, too, though not by Lord
Baltimore.</p>

<p>In 1664, a fleet of vessels was sent over from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
England by the Duke of York, to take possession
of the land. It was his now; the King had given
it to him, in spite of the grant made to Lord
Baltimore years before.</p>

<p>The Duke of York was a very rich and powerful
nobleman. The Dutch did not dare to stand
out against him, no, not even the hot-headed
Governor Stuyvesant himself. Very quietly,
they handed over all the land to the English.
Not a single shot was fired any place, except at
Fort New Amstel. There the Director-General
made one effort to protect the Dutch rights. He
tried to hold the fort, but even the townspeople
were against him. He was soon forced to yield,
and the English soldiers marched in and took
possession. English soldiers filled the fort;
English farmers tilled the ground; Englishmen
made the laws and settled quarrels, and then,
during the time when their government was
being established, the great tract of land north
of the Delaware Province was made over to
William Penn, and a little later the Provinces on
the Delaware were sold to him, too.</p>

<p>But now Lord Baltimore began again to push
his claims to the land. While the Dutch had it,
he was willing to let the matter rest. As long as
the Duke of York owned it, he had been afraid to
dispute about it; but now it belonged to William
Penn, and William Penn was only a private
gentleman.</p>

<p>At one time, Lord Baltimore sent Colonel
George Talbot over from Maryland with a band
of soldiers. They seized a farm near New Castle
that belonged to a Mr. Ogle. On the farm Colonel
Talbot built a fort with palisades, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
put a force of armed men in to defend it. He
declared he was holding it for Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Penn heard that Lord Baltimore
had sailed back to England, there to make
claims on the land before the King’s Privy
Council. Penn then took ship and went back
to England, too, to present his side.</p>

<p>After the Privy Council had heard everything
there was to be said, and had read all the papers
on the question, they gave their decision. The
decision was that Lord Baltimore had no right
to any of the three Provinces on the Delaware.
They were to belong to William Penn. The
boundaries were to be the lines marked out by
the Duke of York,—half the peninsula down to
Cape Henlopen, and a line to be drawn across from
Cape Henlopen to meet the Western boundary.</p>

<p>But somehow the quarrel did not end. Years
passed and Lord Baltimore died, and William
Penn died, and still the boundary dispute went
on. Finally the same old question was decided
in exactly the same way by the Lord Chancellor
of England in 1750, in favor of William Penn’s
children, and the thing was settled at last. But
it was not as easy to mark out the boundary lines
on real land as it is on a map. So because the
marking of them was very difficult, and because
Penn’s heirs and Frederick, the new Lord Baltimore,
wanted the lines settled once for all, two
very good surveyors came over from England in
1763, to run the boundary. The names of these
two surveyors have been famous ever since.
They were Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon.</p>

<p>It was not an easy task that these two surveyors
had undertaken to do. A great part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
land was still wild and unbroken. Savages and
wild beasts lurked in the forests. At night, as
they sat beside their camp fires, they could hear
the long cry of the catamounts off in the wood.
Often an Indian warrior would glide out from
the thickets, and stand watching their work, and
then glide away again, silent as a shadow. The
savages seemed friendly, and indeed some of
them went with the white men as guides, but
there was no knowing when they would turn
against the white men. At one time, word was
brought to Mason and Dixon that the Indians
meant to attack their camp, and twenty-six of
their workmen left, and made their way back to
safety. All work stopped for a while. Then
fresh men came out to take their places, and the
chopping and surveying went on. Great trees
were cut down and rocks were rolled from their
beds. A path eight yards wide was made
through the wilderness, and in this “vistoe” as
they called it, stones were set up to mark the
boundary line. Some of the stones had Penn’s
coat-of-arms carved on them; some were carved
upon one side with “P” for Pennsylvania, and on
the other with “M” for Maryland.</p>

<p>Months slipped by, years passed, and still the
work was not finished.</p>

<p>Then one day the surveyors came to a path
through the forest that crossed the “vistoe” they
were marking out. It was a path worn by the
passing of many Indian feet. Here the savages
who were acting as their guides stopped.</p>

<p>“It is not the will of the Six Nations<a name="FNanchor_4_39" id="FNanchor_4_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_39" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that you
should go further,” they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The white men were very anxious to finish the
line. They had been working on it for over four
years, and it needed thirty-six more miles to
complete it, but the Indians would guide them
no further. “It is not the will of the Six Nations,”
they repeated.</p>

<p>The white men were afraid to push on further
without permission. They were afraid they
would be massacred, so they were obliged to
turn back leaving the line incompleted, and
many, many years passed by before that line
was finally finished.</p>

<p>But Mason and Dixon’s line<a name="FNanchor_5_40" id="FNanchor_5_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_40" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> still marks the
boundaries between the three States of Delaware,
Maryland and Pennsylvania, and here and there
a stone still stands where they set it up in their
“vistoe,” more than a hundred and fifty years
ago. One stone is preserved in the rooms of the
Delaware Historical Society, at Tenth and Market
streets, in Wilmington.</p>

<p>The lines they marked out were those between
Pennsylvania on the north, and Delaware and
Maryland on the south, and between Maryland
and Delaware<a name="FNanchor_6_41" id="FNanchor_6_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_41" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and they did their work so well
that it has never had to be done again.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_41" id="Footnote_6_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_41">[6]</a> In 1909, the original Royal Grants from the King and the
Duke of York to William Penn were given to the Colonial Dames
by Mrs. W. R. Miller of Media, Pennsylvania. These deeds were
given by John Penn, the great grandson of William Penn, to Mr.
John Coates, of Philadelphia in 1811, and had been handed down
and carefully preserved. The Colonial Dames, on receiving
them, presented them formally to the State of Delaware, and
Governor Pennewill accepted them in the name of the Commonwealth,
before the joint session of the Legislature.</p>

<p>They are undoubtedly the most important records ever presented
to this state. They are the Royal Grants, which confer
practically the sovereignty to the State of Delaware of the land
composing its domain. Upon the validity of these Grants the
division lines between Maryland and Delaware were established
in the famous chancery suit in England between William Penn
and Lord Baltimore. In the Pea-patch Island controversy between
New Jersey and Delaware they established Delaware’s
ownership of this island, where Fort Delaware was erected. Also
in the late case between New Jersey and Delaware concerning the
fishery rights within the twelve mile circle, these papers played
an important part.</p></div>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
